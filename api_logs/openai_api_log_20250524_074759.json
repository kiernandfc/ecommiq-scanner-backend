Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Mens Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Titanium/Fabric'\n  - Name='SRPJ87 Seiko 5 Men's Sports'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3i Dive Computer'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sentinel Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPF77 Prospex Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Ana-Digi Dual Display Sports Pathfinder Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR 100 Chronograph watch'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Hagen Black Leather Strap Watch SKW6294'\n  - Name='Orient Defender 21 Jewel Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Tsuyosa Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Automatic Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Skyhawk A-T Men's Eco-Drive JY8075-51E'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Brycen Chronograph Eco-Drive Green Dial Watch CA0851-56X'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Chronograph 'Promaster Navihawk' Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Forerunner 970'\n  - Name='Hamilton Women's Khaki Navy Scuba Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Antique Perpetual Calendar Military Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen ProMaster Sailhawk Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Windfield Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Carraway Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage 1938 Automatic COSC Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 1000 Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force RA-AC0N03E'\n  - Name='MWQ100-3AV | Standard Silver | Casio'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0004E19B'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Breaker Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military Vwi Special Edition Hack Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Series8 880 GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Thin Blue Line Watch CA0291-59E'\n  - Name='RELIC by Fossil Men's Damon Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD79 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Active Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Men’s Thin Red Line Watch Chronograph 200M WR Eco Drive CA0299-57E'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Standard Analog Stainless Steel Dial Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Minimalist Slim Three-Hand Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Foretrex 801 Wrist Mounted GPS'\n  - Name='Skagen Signatur Sport Mens watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Race Powermatic 80 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Goldrun Gold Men's 18K Watch'\n  - Name='25mm Tissot Women's PRX Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

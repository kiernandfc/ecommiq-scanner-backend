    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Garmin Venu GPS Only 8GB'\n  - Name='Orient Tristar Men's Automatic Day/Date Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Golfer'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Navy Pioneer Automatic H78465553 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Open Heart Watch H32565555'\n  - Name='Hamilton-VENtura ELVIS80 SKELETON AUTO Automatic'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2S'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's 14K Yellow Gold Thin-O-Matic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic 3 Star Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Viewmatic Automatic Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Casio Classic MTP-E180L-2AVEF'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivoactive 6 Health & Fitness GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin fenix 7X Pro Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='GARMIN 50 Mm Amoled Display Watch - Black'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Viewmatic Auto'\n  - Name='Casio G Men's-shock Mr-g MRGB2100 Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen SKW6230 Hagen Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Kuppel Lille Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen SKW6476 Men`s Jorn Minimalistic Stainless Steel Gunmetal Mesh Watch - Skagen Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02776-30 Steel Black 42mm'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivomove Style Hybrid Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-01685-02 Fenix 5S Multisport GPS Watch - Silver and Black'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivomove Sport Watches'\n  - Name='Garmin D2 Air X10 GPS'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

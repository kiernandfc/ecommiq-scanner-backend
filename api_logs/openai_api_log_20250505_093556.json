Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Watch Eco Drive Aviator AW1365-19P Web'\n  - Name='Automatic Men's Watch in Steel with Black Dial - Bulova'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Navigator Chronograph Automatic Rubber Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Gent XL Classic'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Phantom Crystal Collection Watch 97A179'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Automatics III'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Suny Genesee Community College Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Race Chonograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Sundby Quartz Analog Watch with Brown Leather Band'\n  - Name='Fossil Nate Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Daley Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Frank Sinatra The Very Thought of You Stainless Steel Watch Gift Set'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Performance Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto 41mm Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Stainless Steel Quartz Watch with Diamonds'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military Style Wind Up'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's Sutton Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRC 200 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Brox Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Sport Watch RA-AK0405Y10B'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Telemeter Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Horizont SKW6702 Men's Quartz'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Navigator Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Race MotoGP Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

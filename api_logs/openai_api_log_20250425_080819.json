Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Q Timex Enigma Reissue 1975 Watch'\n  - Name='TW2W Timex Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Reclaim Ocean Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Nylon Mens Watch SRPE65K1'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SUR434 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch SRPK13K1'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Gmt Sports Style Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SSK005K1 Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Men's Field Gear Sunburst Ana/digi Japan Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Men Seiko 5 Sports Honda Super Cub Limited Edition'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SBSA053 Mechanical Automatic Nylon Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD59 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Pro Trek Atomic Solar Triple Sensor Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Veteran’s Watchmaker Initiative Hack Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Maquina Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hudson Watch 97B225'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Prestige Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Auto Chrono H71626735'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Grenen Lille Solar White Dial Watch SKW3086'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

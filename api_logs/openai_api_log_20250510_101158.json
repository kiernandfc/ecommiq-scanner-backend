Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Titanium Eco-Drive Watch with 7- Month Power Reserve'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Karli Heart Stainless Steel Watch and Strap Set'\n  - Name='Men's Fossil Neutra Chronograph FS5408'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Aaren Naturals Watch SKW6730'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Water Resistant Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3 Tactical Solar / AMOLED 45-50 mm GPS Rugged Outdoor Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Perpetual Chrono A-t Eco-drive CB5898-59E'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Disney Donald Duck Men's Blue Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Catholic University Cardinals Blue Dive Three-Hand Date Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Aqualand Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova-swiss Made A.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Mens Marlin Chronograph Watch TW2W10100'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Camper Nylon Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Mens Digital Chrono Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Field Post Solar Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Post Solar 41mm Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Fossil Defender Solar-Powered Olive Nylon Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Spirit Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Chronograph 'Attesa Men's Satellite Wave GPS' Watch CC4105-69E'\n  - Name='Citizen Radio Controlled Mens CB0010-88 Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-100-1BVMUR Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Pilot Traveler 3HD Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Chronograph'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chemin Des Tourelles'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar Wilson WNBA'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bannon Multifunction Black Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Three-Hand'\n  - Name='Seiko U.s.

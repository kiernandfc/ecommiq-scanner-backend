Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Chandler Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Chronograph Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Stainless Steel White Dial Watch BI5051-51A'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Townsman Brown Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Heavy Duty Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Military Analog Resin Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako 40 Watch RA-AC0Q03S10B'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Quartz Watch Skagen Men's Aaren'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AC0K Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Special Edition Men's SRPK65'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic GMT'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 1000 Chronograph watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Prx Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 2000 Professional Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Townsman Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Heritage Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Chronograph Classic Sutton'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

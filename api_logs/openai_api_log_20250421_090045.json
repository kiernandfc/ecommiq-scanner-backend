Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Classic Watch BU2112-06E'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction'\n  - Name='BQ2467SET Fossil Lux Luther Watch Gift Set'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Two-Tone Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Watch Casio Men's'\n  - Name='Orient Kamasu Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0001B19B'\n  - Name='Watch Digital Casio Men's Pro-Trek'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Icon Watch 97B216'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 96B220 Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Gentleman Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Old Paper Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Misc Classic Chronograph Mens Watch 44mm 96B409'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Working Well Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Watch SKW3154'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch STLS110H-1B2'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Silver Dial Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Orient Symphony III Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Carson Premium Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Gentleman Powermatic 80 Silicium Men's 18K'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Solar-Powered Digital Camo Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako Solar Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Defender Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

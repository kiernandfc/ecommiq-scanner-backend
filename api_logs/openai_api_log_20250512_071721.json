    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Deepwater Reef 200 Quartz Black Dial Watch TW2W74700'\n  - Name='Timex Women's Weekender Canvas Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Peanuts Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Mens unisex-Weekender 38 mm Watch T2N649'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Field H70455553'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's PRX POWERMATIC 80 WATCH'\n  - Name='Hamilton KHAKI FIELD Men's TITANIUM AUTO'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-M305'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Holst Chronograph Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SNZG09K1-var-LS17'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Aerojet Classic Calendar Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Marine Star 98A225 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Black-Tone'\n  - Name='Original Citizen Eco Drive Black Dial Nylon Strap Men's watch BV1085-06E'\n  - Name='Seiko Watch Automatic 'Alpinist' Prospex 39.5MM SPB121J1'\n  - Name='Seiko Spirit Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivoactive 6 Health & Fitness GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Mudmaster Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPH31 Blue Dial Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

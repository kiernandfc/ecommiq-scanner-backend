Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5 Multisport Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Land Series Eco-Drive Radio Wave Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's H804 Eco-Drive Radio Controlled Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sport Solar Brown Dial Men's Watch RA-WJ0004Y10B'\n  - Name='Garmin Tactix 8 51mm Solar Charged Display Elite Premium Tactical GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Tactix 8 Solar Elite 51mm'\n  - Name='Men's Casio General'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch MWD'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S60 GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S42 GPS Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

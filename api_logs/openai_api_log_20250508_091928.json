Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='ORIENT SPORTS Automatic RN-AA0008B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Pilot Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Diver's Wrist Watch AZ-1821'\n  - Name='Bulova Gents Marine Star Diamond Watch 98D127'\n  - Name='Bulova Marine Star Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military Time Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Seiko5 Srpg39k1 Field Series Srpg39k Mechanical (automatic) Navy'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Field Gear Military Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field GMT Sports Style Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Gmt Sports Style Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco-Drive Sport Watch 46mm 10ATM AW1525-81L'\n  - Name='Orient RA-BA0006B Leather Band'\n  - Name='Quartz Watch Fossil Men's Carraway'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-894'\n  - Name='Orient Open Heart Automatic White Dial Men's Watch FAG02002W0'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PR 100 SPORT CHIC CHRONOGRAPH'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3 Tactical Edition 50mm'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Collection'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Collection'\n  - Name='Seiko Sports Field Series Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Ray II Automatic FAA02004B9 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Neutra Brown Leather Chronograph Watch FS5380'\n  - Name='Orient RA-TX0210L Quartz Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

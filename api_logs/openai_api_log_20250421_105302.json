Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD77K1 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 98A167 Classic'\n  - Name='Men's Orient RA-AK0604B10B Sports'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AC0F06L10B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Accu-Swiss Manchester United Percheron Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Pro Trek PRW6900YL5'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watches'\n  - Name='Men's Fossil Grant Sport Chronograph Blue Leather Watch FS5237'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Multi-Year Calendar Automatic Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's FAC00002W0 Bambino 2nd Generation Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Classic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Titanium'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPD91'\n  - Name='Citizen Q&q Falcon Field Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Stainless Steel Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's USAF Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Digital World Time Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Flight II Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Analog Automatic Watch RA-AC0E02S10B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AK0310S10B Sun & Moon'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Stainless Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Skagen Signature Blue Dial Brown Leather Men's Watch SKW6355'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Aktiv Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sport 36mm - Field Suits Series - Black Dial'\n  - Name='Seiko Denham Collaboration Vol. 2 5 Sports The Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Sbsa121 5sport Field Specialist Style Mechanical'\n  - Name='Casio Women's Sports Watch STR-300'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Pathfinder Triple Sensor Watch PAG240'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Three-Hand'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Maquina 98A321'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Aerojet Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Silver Army Black Knights Classic Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic White Grid Dial Watch SNXF05'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Sbsc009 5 Sports Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPK69'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Super Tough Eco-Drive Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Titanium Watch AW1240-57'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPK29 Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Carraway Three-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hack Watch 98A255'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bannon Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Watch Chronograph Fossil Men's Bronson'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Snorkel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Series8 890 Automatic Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Watches Mechanical Automatic 9011-S125804 Stainless Steel Silver mechanical black dial'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Promaster Dive Automatic Watch NB6025-59H'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Collection NB2020-54E Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch SRPD73K1'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Automatic Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko SPB131 Presage Limited Edition Automatic Steel Bracelet'\n  - Name='Citizen Sapphire Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Automatic Black Gold Watch NJ0154-80H'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage SARX055 6R15 Titanium'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Mechanical Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage SARY093 Automatic Self-Winding Mechanical Analog Men Watch NEW'\n  - Name='Mens Hamilton Khaki Field Auto Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Spirit of Liberty Auto'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Frogman Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Pilot Air Zermatt Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Aviation Air Race Auto Watch H76535731 Men's'\n  - Name='Hamilton KHAKI X-WIND AUTO DAY DATE'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster 42mm Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton K-456 Automatic Wrist-watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field'\n  - Name='Hamilton Mens Khaki Base Jump H79715333'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

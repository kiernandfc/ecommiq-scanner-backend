    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Dive-style Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Slim Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Samso Series Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Dial Mens Watch NH9136-88A'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1302P'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTPVD01'\n  - Name='Casio Chronograph 'Edifice' Men's Watch EFS-S640'\n  - Name='Tissot T-Gold Automatic Diamond Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Open Heart FAG00004D0 TAG00004D0 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot T-My Lady 18K Gold Automatic Lady Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Ventura Elvis80 Skeleton Auto'\n  - Name='SKW6851 Skagen Mens Grenen Watch'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Watch Mechanical Open Heart Waterproof NP1011-08A Men's Silver'\n  - Name='Citizen Collection Mechanical Analog Silver Strap Black Dial Men Watch NY4050-54E'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Watch with Telememo'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Oceanographer GMT Watch 98B407'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0L03B00B'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3i – 51 mm, Carbon Gray DLC Titanium Watch with DLC Titanium Band and T2 Transceiver'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Edifice'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Edifice EFR-552'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's E-Line Stainless Steel/Leather'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Automatic Green Dial Watch TW2V24700'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Melbye Multifunction Titanium Watch SKW6078'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Titanium/Fabric'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation Pilot Day Date Auto'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Performer Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Men's Tsuyosa Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Old Paper Dial Watch'\n  - Name='1955 Hamilton Automatic K-454 Sputnik'\n  - Name='Citizen Collection Mechanical AUTOMATIC Silver Watch Men's NB1050-59'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Day Date Auto'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Open Heart Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Power Reserve Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation Pilot Pioneer Auto Chrono H76416155 Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic 150m Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Heritage Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Intra-Matic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='RELIC by Fossil Men's Automatic Skeleton Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Diver Automatic Dial Men's Watch NY0120-01'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Marine Automatic Mens Watch NY0129'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster GMT Automatic Swiss Precision Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Analog Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

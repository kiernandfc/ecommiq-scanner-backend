    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Rugged Core Analog Field Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Field Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Overstripe Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field Date Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Scout 40mm'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Metal Brown Leather Strap Watch T443819J'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sport Tourer Chronograph Watch FS6047'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Watches Khaki Field Titanium Auto 36mm Limited Edition Engineered Garments H70235130'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 2000 Professional Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SBSA017 Men's'\n  - Name='SEIKO SBSA121 SEIKO 5 SPORTS FIELD SPORTS STYLE Black Men's Watch in Box'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SNKL45 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SRPD76K1'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Privateer Chronograph'\n  - Name='Skagen Watches'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0C05L19B'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chandler Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic Black Dial Watch SNK607'\n  - Name='Lorus By Seiko Men's V733-8a10 Quartz Day Date Field Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Outlet Men's Privateer Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Field Gear Military Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

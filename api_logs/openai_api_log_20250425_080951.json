    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster 42mm Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Spirit of Liberty Auto H42415551'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX POWERMATIC 80 Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Lily 2 Active Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AR0004S30B'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivomove Luxe Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Kuppel Lille White Dial Watch SKW'\n  - Name='SEIKO Watch MECHANICAL Mechanical Alpinist Automatic Winding (with Manual Winding) SARB017 Men'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Auto Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Surveyor Men's Watch 96A292'\n  - Name='Bulova 96A276 Aerojet automatic Mens 41mm 3ATM'\n  - Name='Garmin vivomove Sport'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Ballade Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Ultra Slim in Gray Plated Stainless Steel Mesh Bracelet Watch SKW6824'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Lille Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Solar Halo Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Tide Ocean Material Grey Dial Men's Quartz SKW6772 Watch'\n  - Name='Quartz Watch Skagen Men's Aaren'\n  - Name='Skagen Horizont SKW2930 Women's Quartz'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports 55th Anniversary Ultraseven SRPJ79'\n  - Name='Casio Mod.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Watch EF-527D'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice ED535 Round Stainless Steel Formal Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch EQB1000D-1A'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-EL0003B00B Triton Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Le Locle Powermatic 80 20th Anniversary'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Desir Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Stainless Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Day/Date Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 96A206 Wilton'\n  - Name='Bulova Marc Anthony Series X Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Intra-Matic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Melbye Titanium Case with Mesh Men's Band SKW6007 Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Bounce Kids Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 7 LE Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Diver Automatic Green Dial Watch RA-AA0811E19B'\n  - Name='Orient Classic Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 9 Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient RA-AS0103A10B'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Ray Raven II Automatic 200m FAA02003B9 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field 44mm Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

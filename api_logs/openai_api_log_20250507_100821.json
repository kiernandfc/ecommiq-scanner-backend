Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Post Solar 41mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Men`s T49870 Expedition Metal Field Brown Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Allied Chronograph Watch TW2T32900'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Expedition North Sierra TW2V22800'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Chronograph Watch T49905'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Solar Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Field Post Solar Waterproof Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Huckberry Titanium Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition North Automatic Brown Strap Watch TW2V64300JR'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Field Leather Watch T449219J'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Field Watch TW4B16000JV'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Scout TW4B019009J'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field Chronograph Men's Analog Watch with Indiglo Backlight'\n  - Name='Timex Todd Snyder The Military Nylon Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Chronograph 42mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Men's Rugged Slip-Thru Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field 43mm Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-drive Military Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Coachman Chronograph Black Leather CH2564 Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin D2 Mach 1 Aviator Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Voyager Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG41 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch GBX100'\n  - Name='Garmin Lily 2 Smartwatch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

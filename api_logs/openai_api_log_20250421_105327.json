Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Mid-Century 1917-h US Military Issued Korean War Era Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sports Automatic RA-AA0812L19B Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2 Solar Tactical Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct Solar Tactical Edition Premium GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 6X Pro Solar'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='Skagen Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S42 GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Grenen Blue Mother-of-Pearl Dial Date Stainless Steel Men's Watch SKW6519'\n  - Name='Watch Tissot Men's Chrono Xl Classic'\n  - Name='Tissot PRC 100 Solar Quartz watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Seastar 1000 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX watch'\n  - Name='Seastar 1000 GMT Rootbeer Bezel'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 2000 Professional Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Ballade 2 Tone Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR516 Quartz Chronograph watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PRX 25mm watch'\n  - Name='Men's Tissot Heritage Navigator Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's PR516 Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='TISSOT Pr 100 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar Kanji Day Date'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRC 200 Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Automatic Chronograph Green Dial Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

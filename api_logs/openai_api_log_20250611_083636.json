Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Watch Timex TW2V37400 Waterbury Ocean Man 42mm Plastic'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Falcon Eye Chronograph'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Colorado Rockies Resin Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Womens Expedition Fabric Strap Digital Chronograph Watch T49661JT'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Jet Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Men's T5K195 Timex Ironman Triathlon Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Field Leather Watch T449219J'\n  - Name='Q Timex Men's GMT 38mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Chronograph Watch TW2W99100'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Michigan Wolverines Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot T-Touch Connect Solar Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Bethune-Cookman Wildcats Classic Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Stylist Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Sport Luxury Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Shelby x Fossil Grand Tourer Limited-Edition Watch Set'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sport Tourer Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPH31 Blue Dial Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Antique Vintage Citizen Military Trench Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-drive Analog Round Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen AW1571 Steel'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Military Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Automatic Fieldmaster SBDY101 / SRPG15K'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex 1965 Heritage Diver's Watch SPB451J1'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Titanium Auto'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive One Solar Powered Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Star Automatic Silver Dial Mens Watch RE-AU0502S00B'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Suits Style Automatic SRPD73 SRPD73K1 SRPD73K 100M Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Surveyor Men's Watch 96A292'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 7 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Mens Ancher Titanium & Stainless Steel Watch SKW6432'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPJ85 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz h69401960'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Military 100M Camo Blue Dial Automatic Men's Watch SRP223K1'\n  - Name='TISSOT SIDERAL S POWERMATIC 80 Men's WATCH'\n  - Name='Orient Star Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin vivomove Trend Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Astron SBXB053 / SSE053 GPS Solar Dual-Time'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Men's Automatic Watch SRPK31K1'\n  - Name='BULOVA Men's Snorkel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Star Automatic Blue Mother of Pearl Dial Mens Watch RE-BY0004A00B'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Star RE-AT0201G00B'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

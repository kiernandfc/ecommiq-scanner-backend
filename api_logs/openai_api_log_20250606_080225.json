Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Georgetown Hoyas Classic Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin quatix 5 Sapphire'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Easton Three-Hand Watch'\n  - Name='Black Fossil Men's Machine Steel Chronograph Watch FS4552'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Sutton Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Navy Midshipmen Classic Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Sutton Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 98A255 Steel Black 38mm'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Watch Classic 96A133'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Chronograph Diamond Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova University of the South Tigers Classic Round Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's Quartz Crystals Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Latin Grammy Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Vintage'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Chicago White Sox Classic Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Modern Automatic Watch 98A203'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5S Plus'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Quartz Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Race Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 1000 Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S40 GPS Golf Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova 1940 War Reprint A 15 Pilot Military Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Contemporary Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct Solar Standard Edition'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

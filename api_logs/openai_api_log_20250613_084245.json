Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='SKW6850 Skagen Mens Grenen Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 255S'\n  - Name='Skagen - Watch skagen ancher skw6321'\n  - Name='Skagen - Watch Smartwatch Skagen Connected Falster Skt5102'\n  - Name='Tissot Le Locle Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='Tissot Quickster Chrono'\n  - Name='Tissot Prc200 Quartz T028.410.11.037.00'\n  - Name='Tissot Prc200 Chrono T055.217.16'\n  - Name='CASIO Timeless Collection Horloge MRW-200HD-1BV | Zwart'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPG33K1 Aço Verde 39.4mm 2024'\n  - Name='Fossil FS4656'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Horloge GA-2100FLS-8A2 by CASIO | Grijs/Transparante kleur'\n  - Name='Bulova Casual Men's Watch BLV 98A199'\n  - Name='Ready Bulova Men'S 96A135 Bva-Series 120 Automatic Terbatas'\n  - Name='Jam Tangan Berlapis Emas Bulova Vintage - Kondisi Sangat Baik'\n  - Name='Bulova Casual Men's Watch BLV 96B337 Marine Star Chrono Quartz'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3'\n  - Name='ORIENT Sports Mako III 波浪紋週年限量版 RA-AA0822L RA-AA0822L19B'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 970'\n  - Name='Orient 東方錶 計時 石英 皮帶錶 RA-KV0405S10B'\n  - Name='Orient \"Mako-3\" 日本自動/手動上鏈 200 公尺潛水員風格手錶'\n  - Name='Herren Tissot Heritage 1936'\n  - Name='Tissot T-Race Chronograph'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Titanium Automatic men klocka TW2V54000'\n  - Name='Timex MK1 Resin 36mm Tan Dial'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Taylor Stitch\"\nReference Product Name: \"The Jack Shirt\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Oxford button-down is a stylish wardrobe staple with endless versatility, so it’s no surprise that our signature Oxford, The Jack, has become a mainstay of our roster.

Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly versatile fabric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled off the back of a chair.

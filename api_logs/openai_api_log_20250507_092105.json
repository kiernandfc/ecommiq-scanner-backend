    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Wave CEPTOR Solar Men's Watch Radio WVA-M630'\n  - Name='G-Shock Watch gav01'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Hand-wound Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's FS4705 Analog Grey Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Caravelle Military Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0C05L19B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Dress Classic Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Grenen Solar Powered Ocean Blue Leather Strap Watch 37mm SKW6834'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-shock Mudmaster Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic GMT Field Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako III Automatic RA-AA0004E19B Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Tide Ocean Material Grey Dial Men's Quartz SKW6772 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Mudmaster Watch'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's G-SHOCK Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

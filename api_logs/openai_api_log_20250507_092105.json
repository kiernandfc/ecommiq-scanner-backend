Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Wave CEPTOR Solar Men's Watch Radio WVA-M630'\n  - Name='G-Shock Watch gav01'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Hand-wound Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's FS4705 Analog Grey Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Caravelle Military Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0C05L19B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Dress Classic Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Grenen Solar Powered Ocean Blue Leather Strap Watch 37mm SKW6834'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-shock Mudmaster Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic GMT Field Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako III Automatic RA-AA0004E19B Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Tide Ocean Material Grey Dial Men's Quartz SKW6772 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Mudmaster Watch'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's G-SHOCK Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

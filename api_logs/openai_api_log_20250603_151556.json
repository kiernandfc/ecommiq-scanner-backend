Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio Men's G Shock'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Daley Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch with Leather Band'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PR 100 Sport Chic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Battery Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Day-Date Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Day-Date Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sports Automatic Black Dial Watch RA-AC0Q01B10B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch 40mm 10ATM RA-AR0102S10B'\n  - Name='Man Tissot Pendants'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Le Locle Automatic watch'\n  - Name='Tissot 10920 Manual Lady's Watch'\n  - Name='Mathey-Tissot Men's Field Scout Chronograph Swiss Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Solar Quartz'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field King Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Tank Power Reserve Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Orient RA-AC0J Automatic/Handwinding Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Freja Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 165 Music'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Weekender Collection\"\nReference Product Description:\nWe’re bringing a fresh burst of energy to our beloved Weekender with elevated details, like a sleek new 40mm case, a new crown design, and a slip-thru strap design that makes it easy to swap out the eco-friendly leather strap sourced from the Leather Working Group (LWG) for one in another color or print. It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Calendrier Moonphase Watch BU0057-54E'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Coachman Chronograph Leather Watch CH2565'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Hagen Japanese Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale. Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern. Return the results in the specified JSON format (an object with a 'scores' array, where each item has 'competitor_product_name', 'relevancy_score', and 'rationale' explaining why you assigned that score).\n",

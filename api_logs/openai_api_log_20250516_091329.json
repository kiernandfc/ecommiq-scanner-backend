Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

This iteration is rendered in an organic cotton twill that’s reverse-engineered from deadstock military fabric, so it’ll stand up to years of hard wear and pick up incredible character along the way.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Levi's Green Plaid Cotton Plaid Sherpa Lined Shacket Men's'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Teton Valley Quilted Blazer'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Movement Knit Blazer'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Legend Sweater Shirt'\n  - Name='Faherty Brand Men's Felted Wool Bland Chore Coat'\n  - Name='Levi's Men's Chore Canvas Jacket'\n  - Name='Filson Men's Tin Cloth Primaloft Jacket'\n  - Name='Norse Projects Thor Rain Coat'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Whitewater Full Zip Hoodie'\n  - Name='Filson Men's Lined Mackinaw Wool Cape Coat'\n  - Name='Barbour Women's Flyweight Quilted Jacket'\n  - Name='Barbour Men's Lorden Waterproof Mac Jacket'\n  - Name='Barbour Flyweight Cavalry Quilted Jacket Womens Olive Size: 18'\n  - Name='Barbour Corbridge Jacket'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Titainium Promaster Marine Automatic Black Dial Watch NY0071-81E'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Classic'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Automatic'\n  - Name='CITIZEN SERIES 8 AUTOMATIC 40MM NA1034-51H'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watches'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Wave Ceptor Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Citizen Collection Mechanical automatic winding (with manual winding) Men's type NY4057-63P'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-6149'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Watches Mechanical Automatic NA1010-84X 0950-S125758 Stainless Steel , Stainless Steel Silver Series 8 White shell dial mens Used Authentic'\n  - Name='Citizen Mens Automatic Promaster Air GMT NB6045-51H'\n  - Name='Citizen Watch Automaticos Nh8391-51l Movimiento Automatico Calibre S201 - Citizen'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='SEIKO 5 SPECIALIST SELF WINDING MECHANICAL MEN WATCH SBSA027'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Mechanical Day-Date Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Automatic Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Elegance Mens Automatic NH9131'\n  - Name='Seiko Mechanical Automatic Dress Line Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Mechanical Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Ray II Automatic FAA02005D9 Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Prx Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's FAG00001S0 Esteem II Open Heart Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Envoy Japanese Automatic Hand Winding Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Mens NY4058 Armbanduhr'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Cocktail Time SRPK15 Gradated Blue Dial 40.5mm Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage SARY185 Mechanical Automatic Japanese Garden Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chemin des Tourelles Automatic Swiss Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's G-SHOCK WATCH'\n  - Name='Tissot Tradition Powermatic 80 Open Heart Silver Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch H69409930'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Tradition Powermatic 80 Open Heart 40mm Watch T063.907.36.068.00'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-One Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch Dial'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T0064083605700 Le Locle Automatic'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Brox Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Tradition Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Couturier Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's M-Force Automatic RA-AC0N01B10B Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR516 Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Hagen watch SKW6274'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Holst Chronograph Gunmetal Steel-Mesh Watch SKW6608'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Slim Two-Tone Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

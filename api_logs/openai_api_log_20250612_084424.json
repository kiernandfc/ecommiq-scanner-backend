    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex IRONMAN T200 42mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Weekender x Peanuts Van Fabric Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Traditional Fly Back Chronograph'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Mtd-125D'\n  - Name='Orient Star Power Reserve Automatic Japan Made RE-AW0004S00B Men's Watch - White Dial, Stainless Steel Case, Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AC0K03L10B'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Pilot Flight RA-AC0H03B10B Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Star Contemporary RE-AT0019L Limited Edition + 5 let záruka a dárek ZDARMA'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0K01B10B'\n  - Name='Orient Star Steel'\n  - Name='Orient Symphony IV Men's Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H70605140'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar 1000 Quartz Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Tsuyosa Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Tradition Black Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch LF30W'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Diver Solar Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Classic Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0J03L10B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Open Heart Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient College Vintage Japanese Original Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 2 Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient RA-AC0F07S30B'\n  - Name='Orient Ra-ac0q07v30b'\n  - Name='Citizen Suratto Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

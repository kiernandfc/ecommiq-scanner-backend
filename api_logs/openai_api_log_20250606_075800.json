    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Water Resistant Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Vintage Automatic Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Timex Vintage Automatic Self Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Viscount 1976 White Dial Vintage 1970s Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Boost Shock 47mm'\n  - Name='Timex Vintage Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Mechanical Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Pride Steel Automatic Timex'\n  - Name='Timex Vintage Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's GW-5000U-1JF Solar Radio Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Stainless Steel Analog Watch Women's MTP-1405D-1A'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EF-316D-1AVEG'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPD89'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Mechanical Automatic Winding'\n  - Name='Seiko Women's Series 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Mechanical Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Air Skyhawk Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Men's Quatix 3 Marine Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Skeleton Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Mechanical Automatic Gold Plated Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Carson Powermatic 80 watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

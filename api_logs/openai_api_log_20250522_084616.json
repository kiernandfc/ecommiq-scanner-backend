    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Calendar Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Date Indicator Watch'\n  - Name='SNK357 Seiko 5 Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD63 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-SHOCK Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-M305'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Black Men's Watch - EFV-630D-1AVUDF'\n  - Name='G-shock Full Metal Men's Watch Casio'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Men's EFB-710D Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dalton Three-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Automatic Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AP0002S10B'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Envoy Automatic Blue Dial Watch TAG00004 TAG00004D0'\n  - Name='Orient Open Heart Automatic Mens Black Dial Watch FAG02004B0'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Mako Kamasu Automatic RA-AA0820R19B Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Fish Eye Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Lily 2 Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 2000 Professional Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot T-My Lady Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dalton Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 4 Automatic Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dalton Blue Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's SKW6360 Stainless Steel Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

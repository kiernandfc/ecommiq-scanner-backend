Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Full Luminous Dial Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba AQpk401 Military Full Luminous Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Field Specialist Style Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Dial Men's Watch AW0100-86'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Military Automatic Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Quartz Green Dial Men's Watch SKW6772'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Classic RA-AA0C06E19B Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 45 GPS Running Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Powermatic 80 T137'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2S Solar'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chrono Xl Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Supersport Chrono Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S44 GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Prx Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Holst Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men 562sssw Multifunction Silver Mesh Band 31mm Quartz Analog'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar 1000 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Touch Connect Solar Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's SEASTAR 1000 CHRONOGRAPH Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

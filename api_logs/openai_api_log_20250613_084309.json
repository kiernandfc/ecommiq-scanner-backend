Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch TW4B23000'\n  - Name='Timex Watches TW4B14100 Mens Scout Watch'\n  - Name='män TW2W16000 Timex Expedition north klocka'\n  - Name='Herr TW2W22600 Timex Waterbury traditionell herrklocka'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North TIDE TEMP Compass Watch'\n  - Name='and Wander x TIMEX expedition north field post solar men'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Sierra Klocka'\n  - Name='Timex Mens Tide Klocka T2N720'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field 40 mm herrklocka förlängningsarmband i rostfritt stål'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Field Post Solar TW2V03700'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field watch T49905'\n  - Name='TIMEX Expedition North Sierra 40mm'\n  - Name='Timex Military MK1 36mm TW2W91200'\n  - Name='Timex Men's TW4B01900 Expedition Scout 40 Black Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Ridge Chronograph watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout nylonrem herrklocka'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition CAT5 41mm Watch TW4B30400'\n  - Name='Timex Watch Expedition North TW2V00400 Men's'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Digital Expedition Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Traprock Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Mens Expedition TW4B00100 Quartz'\n  - Name='Expedition Field Chronograph 43MM Leather Strap Watch Men's Timex | Black/Tan'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field herrarmbandsur 43 mm brunt armband'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Freedive Ocean 46mm'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field Solar herrarmbandsur 43 mm, svart silikonarmband, svart urtavla, IP-stålhus TW4B30800, SVART, Sport/utomhus'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Grenen Solar Halo Midnight Stainless Steel Mesh Black Dial SKW6874 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Titanium Multifunction Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-shock Men's'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Stainless Steel Tachymeter Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Murph 38mm H70405130'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Collection WS-1700H'\n  - Name='Casio Watch LF-20W'\n  - Name='Fossil FS-4123 Arkitekt Black Dial/Band Mens Chronograph Watch 7”'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch h69419933'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field H69619533'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3 Dive Computer'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Gentleman Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Foretrex 801 Wrist-Mounted GPS Navigator'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2 GPS Rugged Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivoactive 5 Smartwatch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Seastar 1000 36mm Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPF79 Prospex'\n  - Name='Seiko x Estnation Prospex Fieldmaster Solar Tuna Limited'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Military Mudman Limited Edition'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='G-Shock Watch Casio Men's GA-140'\n  - Name='Men's CASIO G-SHOCK Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova 98A325 MIL SHIPS Bronze'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

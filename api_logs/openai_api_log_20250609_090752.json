    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 96A225 Lunar Pilot Chronograph'\n  - Name='Skagen Riis Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 235'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3i Dive Computer'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Land Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Black Dial Watch SRPH33K1'\n  - Name='Bulova 96A259'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Enticer Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Precisionist Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Anita'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Hald Steel Mesh Band Watch SKW2445'\n  - Name='Militado Hamilton Khaki Field Homage Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Monty Chronograph Two Tone Stainless Steel Quartz FS5636 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen stainless steel skw3102'\n  - Name='Garmin tactix Charlie Smart Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5S Plus'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

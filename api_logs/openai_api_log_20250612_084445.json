Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 7 LE Copper Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sporty Kingmaster Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Star Green Dial Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Star RE-AU0004B00B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mechanical Automatic Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster BN0261-51E Men's Eco-Drive 200m Diver'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Marvel 80th Anniversary Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Navigator'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage Visodate'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRC 200 Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch AQS820W'\n  - Name='Casio Mens Black Watch MRW-230H-1E2VEF'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Tri Star Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Ra-ak0805e30b'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Bambino Automatic Watch Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5 Plus'\n  - Name='Casio Watch A700WE'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Star RE-AT0108L00B Mechanical Semi Skeleton'\n  - Name='Orient Ra-ar0007s30b'\n  - Name='Orient Star Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Day Date Dial'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Tradition GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Watch Drive BM6985-55E'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

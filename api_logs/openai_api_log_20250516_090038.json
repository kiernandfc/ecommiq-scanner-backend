    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Accessories Women's Vintage Non-Working Watch'\n  - Name='C772 Men's 1963 Vintage Timex Self Wind Automatic Auto Watch'\n  - Name='1970s Kelton Automatic by Timex Watch for Parts & Repair - NOT WORKING'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Stretch Band Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Women's Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Timex x Peanuts Marlin'\n  - Name='Timex Accessories Vintage 1985 Barrel Viscount Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Viscount Self-wind Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Snoopy Secret Agent Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Date Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Runs'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Matic Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SBSA117 Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Watch 5 Sports SRPD95'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sport Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Classic Line Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Black Dial Watch SRPH33K1'\n  - Name='Seiko Seiko 5 Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch SNK607'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Selection Mechanical Self-Winding Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 SNK793 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

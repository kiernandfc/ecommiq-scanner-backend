    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Automatic Running Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Seiko 5 Sports Special Edition Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch SRPK67K1'\n  - Name='Men's Black Fossil Twist Arkitekt Me-1017 110711 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Women's 358XSSLBC Skagen Freja Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's 347sdxd Fashion Pave Quartz'\n  - Name='Seiko SZSB018 Automatic Mechanical Classic line'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko Presage Cocktail Time'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Diver SRP495 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Solar Powered Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-SHOCK Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Series 100 Waterproof / Sports Mechanical Green SRPD75K1'\n  - Name='Fossil Townsman Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Jelly Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Heritage Automatic Black Dial Unisex Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Prx Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Accessories Automatic Movement Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Mellem Lille'\n  - Name='Skagen Titanium Slimline Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic 689a Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Intra-Matic Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

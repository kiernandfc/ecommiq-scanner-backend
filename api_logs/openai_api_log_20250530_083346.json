Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Tide-Temp-Compass Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Garrison Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Seiko Mens 5 Sports SRPG63 Nylon watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SUR375 Essentials Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPC63K1 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Men's Fossil Bannon Multifunction'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Tillie Mini Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Fossil Silver Blue Dive Three-Hand Date Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='RELIC by Fossil Men's Damon Automatic Stainless Steel Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Outlet Eevie Three-Hand Date Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field GMT Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Stainless Steel Battery Easy Read Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Northeastern Huskies Minimalist Slim Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Quartz Green Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Montana Grizzlies Minimalist Slim Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil MEN The Minimalist Three-Hand Two-Tone Stainless Steel Watch - Blue - One size'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Forerunner 970'\n  - Name='Timex Ironman Classic 30-Lap 38mm Digital Black'\n  - Name='Timex Men's US Military Academy Army Black Knights Clutch Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Stainless Steel Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='-G Watch Casio Baby Women's'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Mudman Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Penny Three-Hand Quartz Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

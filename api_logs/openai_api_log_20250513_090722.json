    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex x Peanuts Marlin Automatic Saxophone'\n  - Name='1970s Automatic Timex Mechanical Winding Watch with Date Function'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='TW2W59900 Timex Men's Marlin Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Diver Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Core Two Tone Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Spirit of Liberty Auto Watch H42445551'\n  - Name='Citizen Tsuyosa Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Watch H70455553'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Watch Automaticos Mako RA-AC0Q02L10B'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar Wilson WNBA'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPE71 5 Sports Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko Presage SSA343'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SARX091 Watch Black'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex LX Spring Drive U.s.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK GM-B2100AD-2A'\n  - Name='Orient Multi-Year Calendar Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Elegance Mens Automatic NH9131'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Watch Automatic Teal Dial'\n  - Name='Citizen Series8 870 Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch NA1037-53L'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Marine Men's Automatic Watch NY0120-01'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic SNZF17J1'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Automatic Titanium Skeleton Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Steel-Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Blue Dial Men's Brown Synthetic leather Band Presage Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Forerunner 970'\n  - Name='Casio Explorer Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 570'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Men's Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's 983xlbb Black Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Automatic GMT'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Bright Metallic Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Model 3446'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Water Resist Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-Shock Women's'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

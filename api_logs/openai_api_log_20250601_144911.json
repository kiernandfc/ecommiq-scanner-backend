Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko SBSC009'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Field Gear Sun & Moon Day Date Calender'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Chronograph'\n  - Name='Casio MDV-10 Men's'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED Sapphire'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage 1938 Automatic COSC Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Peanuts Marlin 38mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Post Solar Waterproof Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPK99 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko SRPG27K1'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SPB249 Prospex Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 96B440'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2 Solar Tactical Edition'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's The Citizen AQ4106-00W Titanium LIMITED 300'\n  - Name='Orient RA-AG0005L10B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's 'Mako II' Japanese Automatic / Hand-Winding Stainless Steel 200 Meter Diving Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG31 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Military Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch AQS820W'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

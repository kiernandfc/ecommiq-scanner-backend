Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch WV200'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Open Heart Classic Golden Eye II Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Athlete'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct Crossover Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Mw-600 Men's Field Watch, Red Dial, 100 Meter Wr, Date'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch W-218H'\n  - Name='Casio Accessories | Casio Field Watch Mtpe190-1bv | Color: Black/Cream | Size: Os | Pm-37347081's Closet'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Mud Resistant Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's'\n  - Name='Rare Vintage Casio Military Field Watch Mtp-1132 Luminous Hands Date'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Digital'\n  - Name='Bulova Ord Dept 10ak Us Military Issued Wwii Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Defender Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Textile Strap 33 Mm Black Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin D2 Mach 1 Aviator Smartwatch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Prx Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 1000 Chronograph Diver's Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Timex Q Falcon Eye Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

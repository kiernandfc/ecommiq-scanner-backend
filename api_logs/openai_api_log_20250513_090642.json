Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SSB337 Conceptual Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Gold & Silver Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Snke01 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Sport Quartz Black Dial Men's Watch SUR560P1'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Special Edition Men's Black Checkered Automatic Watch SRPK67'\n  - Name='Casio MRW210H-3AV 3H Analog Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen - Citizen Eco-Drive Perpetual Alarm World Time Chronograph GMT Blue Dial Men's Watch AT8260-85L'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Evanston Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Brox Multifunction'\n  - Name='Bulova Mens 96B447 Watch Hudson Automatic 39mm 3ATM'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Wilton Watch 96B386'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SPC011 Retrograde Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Mens Autocross Multifunction'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Privateer Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Blue Watch BQ2869'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Green Watch BQ2878'\n  - Name='Fossil Outlet Men's Brox Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Perpetual Calender Two-Tone Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

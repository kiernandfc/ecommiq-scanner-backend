Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Taylor Stitch\"\nReference Product Name: \"The Jack Shirt\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Oxford button-down is a stylish wardrobe staple with endless versatility, so it’s no surprise that our signature Oxford, The Jack, has become a mainstay of our roster. Its burly 100% organic cotton basket weave and double-needle felled construction make it sturdy enough to stand up to the roughest workday, while peerless tailoring and a clean, pleatless design means it’s snazzy enough for your next night on the town. Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly versatile fabric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled off the back of a chair.

Made from our burly rugby oxford. Our signature Jack button-down collar. Garment dyed and washed for a soft, lived-in feel. Double-needle felled construction throughout. Natural buttons.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio - W-218H'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Kanno RA-AA0010B19B Automatic Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Ray II Automatic 200m FAA02005D9 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil MEN Townsman Automatic Leather Watch - Brown - Black - One size'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Casio AE1000W Series Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Watch 35mm'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen ProMaster Land U822'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPG39 Watch'\n  - Name='Casio protrek Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Carlie Three-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Riley Watch ES2811'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 165 Music'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Northeastern Huskies Blue Dive Three-Hand Date Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Stainless Steel Solar-Powered Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Monty Chronograph Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmo Two-Tone Bracelet Strap & Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Machine Automatic Grey Dial Men's Watch ME3254'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's SMU Mustangs Machine Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Field Watch T49870'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Chrono/Alarm/Timer Watch'\n  - Name='T49961 Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Watch Chrono Alarm Timer'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Chronograph Tachymeter Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Camper Watch T40011'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Rugged Metal Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Watch TW4B00100'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field 43mm Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's-Archive Mil Ships 98A266'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 4 Automatic Dress Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Digital Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch WS2100H'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic 21 Jewels Water Resistant Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Men's RN-AA0003R Automatic Mechanical Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Calendrier Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's \"Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Promaster CB5004-59W'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Dial Men's Watch AW0100-86'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Brycen Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Garrison Chronograph Super Titanium AT2480-81'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

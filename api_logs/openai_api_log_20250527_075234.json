    "system_prompt": "You are an AI assistant evaluating product relevancy.\nYour goal is to determine how relevant a list of competitor products are to a specific reference product, based on names and descriptions.\nOutput the scores as a JSON object containing a single key 'scores', which is an array of objects. Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Ledge Lounger\"\nReference Product Name: \"Essential Umbrella\"\nReference Product Description:\nOur multi-operational Essential Umbrella features an aluminum center pole and is ideal for both in-pool and on-deck use. High-quality materials, such as fiberglass ribs, sewn-in vents, and marine-grade fabrics make the Essential Umbrella resistant to wind, corrosion, rust, and warping. Choose from hundreds of canopy and pole combinations to create the perfect umbrella to match your personal style.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Ledge Lounger Octagon Pulley Premier Umbrella, 11' / Turquoise'\n  - Name='Ledge Lounger Select Umbrella - Square | Patio Accessories 7.5' Square / Capri / Black'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale. Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern. Return the results in the specified JSON format (an object with a 'scores' array, where each item has 'competitor_product_name', 'relevancy_score', and 'rationale' explaining why you assigned that score).\n",

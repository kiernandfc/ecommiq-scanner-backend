Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Mudman Watch'\n  - Name='Casio W-94hf-3av Standard'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Neutra Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports The 20th anniversary Limited Edition Blue Gradation Dial Quartz Diver's RA-TX0208L 200M Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Ray Raven II Automatic 200m FAA02003B9 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient SK Diver Retro Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0C05L19B'\n  - Name='G-Shock Men's Rangeman'\n  - Name='SEIKO 5 SPORTS Sports Field SBSC009 Automatic Men's watch Limited'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Sports Gmt'\n  - Name='Black Fossil Men's Machine Steel Chronograph Watch FS4552'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Classic RA-AG0028L10B'\n  - Name='Men Orient Orient Quartz Stainless Steel Watch FUG1H001W6'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage Petite Seconde Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Three-Hand'\n  - Name='Casio Men's MRW200H-1BV Classic Analog Dive-Style Watch'\n  - Name='Orient RA-AC0Q10N Mako'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Military Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Contemporary Chronograph White Dial Mens Watch RA-TX0305S'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's Marine Star Watch 96L324'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Rat Pack Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Marine Star 96A291'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

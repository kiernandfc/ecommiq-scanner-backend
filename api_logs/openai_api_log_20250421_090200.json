Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='TISSOT Pr 100 Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3 Rugged Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Chrono XL Classic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Watch Tissot Men's Chrono Xl Classic'\n  - Name='Orient RA-AA0915R19B Japanese Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 96B416 Luxury Mens Watch 40mm 10ATM'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sport Tourer Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova SMU Mustangs Classic Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Sutton Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Pro-Trek PRJ-B001'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H70225540 Steel Blue 37mm'\n  - Name='Bulova Polk State College Eagles Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watches'\n  - Name='96A208 Bulova Men's Sutton Silver Black Dial Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Railroad Automatic Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H70225130 Steel Black 37mm'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Officer Mechanical Ref.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Chandler Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch GDB500'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Sol Solar-Powered Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Triton Automatic RA-AC0K03L10B Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Touch Connect Solar Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Sport Casual Watch AW1710-80E'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Sport Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive PCAT Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco-Drive Watch Black Dial BM7550-10E'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Endeavour Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Promaster Air GMT Men's NB6045-51H'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men Ancher Three-Hand Date Gunmetal Steel-Mesh Watch Grey - One size'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Holst Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen - Jorn Brown Leather Chronograph - SKW6477 - 768680274585'\n  - Name='SKAGEN Mod GRENEN CHRONOGRAPH'\n  - Name='Skagen SKW6461 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex LX Spring Drive U.s.

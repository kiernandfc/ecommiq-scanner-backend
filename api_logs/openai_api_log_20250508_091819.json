It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Essentials Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Classic Analog Camo Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Avion Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Quartz Two-Tone Watch BI5054-53L'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Automatic Stainless Steel American Clipper Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Silver Quartz Analog Men's Watch BF0610-91A'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Minimalist Quartz Gray Stainless Steel Watch with Gray Dial'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Kulor Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Ultra Slim Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Dartmouth 2-Tone Stainless Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Archive Series Limited Edition MIL-SHIPS-W-2181 Men's Watch 98A265'\n  - Name='Bulova Surveyor Men's Watch 96A292'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Auto Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

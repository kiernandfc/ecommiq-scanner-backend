Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Legacy Day and Date Quartz Green Dial Watch TW2V68000'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Blue Canvas Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Blue Angels Skyhawk Men's Watch Boxed Set JY8128-56L'\n  - Name='Casio Watch LF-20W'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch MWA-100H'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 98b245 Classic Black Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Outlet Men's Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch Set'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Hand Winding H694390'\n  - Name='Hamilton Military Khaki Field Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Holst Slim Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Promaster Air Skyhawk Atomic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Essentials Quartz Black Dial Men's Watch SUR360'\n  - Name='Casio Men's AW81D-2AV Ana-Digi Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic SRPE'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Ansel Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Carson Premium Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Stainless Steel Bracelet'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Pioneer H60419533'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

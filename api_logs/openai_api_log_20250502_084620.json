    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic 40mm TW2W93200'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Standard Stainless Steel Silver Dial Analog Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Casioak GA2100 Mod Royal Oak G-Shock GA-2100 Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports SRPG37 Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Mechanical Date Automatic'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Core Stainless-steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='SKAGEN Mod SIGNATUR'\n  - Name='Skagen Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Freja Two-Hand Rose Gold-Tone Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Super Slim Matte Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Horisont Special Edition SKW2738'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Anita Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen X Baum Und Pferdgarten Three-Hand Two-Tone Stainless Steel Watch - Gold / Silver'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Eqb-501xbl-2ajf Smartphone Link Model Men's Watch In Box EQB-501XBL-2ACF'\n  - Name='Casio G Shock GW-A1000-1ADR'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Skagen Nillson Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Freja Crystal Slim Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Seastar 1000 36mm Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Watch EFR-526L'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Women's GMD-S5610PP-4ER Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

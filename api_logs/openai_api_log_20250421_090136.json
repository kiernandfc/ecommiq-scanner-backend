Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SNZG09K1-var-NATO25'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Dial Watch AW1750'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's US Army Classic Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko Prospex Field Automatic Leather Watch SRPD31K1'\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio G-Shock Solar Powered Digital Analog Watch GSTS310-1A'\n  - Name='Bulova Military 98A255 Steel Black 38mm'\n  - Name='Bulova Buffalo State Bengals Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military 24h Dial Manual Wind Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 96a245 1940 Reprint Military Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hack Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Fossil Grant Watch FS5183'\n  - Name='Fossil Carraway Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Quartz Black Dial Watch H68551833'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hack Automatic Ivory Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto Chrono'\n  - Name='Bulova Very Old Vintage Military Style Two-Tone Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova VWI Hack Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Sutton Automatic Open Aperture Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Officer H706150 Steel Black 44mm'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 3 Smartwatch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

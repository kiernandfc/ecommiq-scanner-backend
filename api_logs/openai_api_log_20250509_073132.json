    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Watches H325150 Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Automatic Date Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Swiss Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Bambino Automatic RA-AP0003S30B Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Day-Date Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage Men's Sarf005 Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Heritage Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sun and Moon Automatic White Dial Men's Watch RA-AK0306S10B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Kamasu RA-AA0006L19B Automatic Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Orient Kamasu Automatic Watch RA-AA0003R19B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Bambino RA-AK0701S10B Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Regatta Automatic Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Formal Date Quartz'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Original Boyfriend Automatic Skeleton Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Crewmaster Sport Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Women's Fossil Stella Automatic watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki X-wind Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex 1965 Diver Re-interpretation Automatic Watch, 40.5mm, SPB239'\n  - Name='Hamilton Watches H375650 Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

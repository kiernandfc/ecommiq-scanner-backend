Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

High-quality materials, such as fiberglass ribs, sewn-in vents, and marine-grade fabrics make the Essential Umbrella resistant to wind, corrosion, rust, and warping. Choose from hundreds of canopy and pole combinations to create the perfect umbrella to match your personal style.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Stainless Steel Bottom Poles'\n  - Name='Purple Leaf Cantilever Patio Umbrella'\n  - Name='PURPLE LEAF Cantilever Umbrella Rectangle Outdoor Patio Umbrella Large Umbrella with 360-Degree Rotation Adjustable with Base'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale. Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern. Return the results in the specified JSON format (an object with a 'scores' array, where each item has 'competitor_product_name', 'relevancy_score', and 'rationale' explaining why you assigned that score).\n",

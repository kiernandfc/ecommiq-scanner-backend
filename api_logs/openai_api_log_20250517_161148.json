Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Orient - Orient Open Heart Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch FAG02001B0'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Military Watch Box Set'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Dial Men's Watch AW1780-17L'\n  - Name='Bulova Air Force Falcons Stainless Steel Classic Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRC 200 Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Hagen Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Japanese Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Eco Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Paradigm Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Watch Classic 96A133'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Marine Star 96B434 Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Maquina Chronograph Watch 98B380'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's BVA Automatic Mechanical Self-Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Crosby Three-Hand Date Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Retro Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Utah Utes Classic Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch Classic 96B261'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Regatta Automatic 3ATM Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field 40MM Auto Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Mens Watch RA-AA0822L19B'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Luxury Watch'\n  - Name='CITIZEN THE CITIZEN AQ4091-56E MADE IN JAPAN JDM'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Classic Automatic Croco Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen NY0145-86EE Automatic Divers Promaster Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Citizen Automatic White Dial Two-Tone Men's Watch NH9136-88A'\n  - Name='Citizen Open Hearts Skeleton Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Seikojust mod daydate automatic watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-Shock Men's'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch W-218H'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Tri Star Automatic FAB00009'\n  - Name='Citizen Tsuyosa Minnie Mouse Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Mens Ancher Titanium & Stainless Steel Watch SKW6432'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Hagen Black Leather Strap Watch SKW6294'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Kristoffers Multifunction Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='ORIENT Automatic Mechanical Casual Classic SAC08003A0 Beige'\n  - Name='Casio Baby-g White And Gold Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Vintage Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Accessories Men's Sport Luxury Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex Automatic Diver SRPL13'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Hald Watch SKW6175'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Three-Hand Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's AW80D-7A2VDF Analog-Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Vintage Watch AQ-800E'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Gw-a1000-1a Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-shock Men's'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Taylor Stitch\"\nReference Product Name: \"The Democratic Chino\"\nReference Product Description:\nOriginally issued to American soldiers during WWII, the first military chinos were celebrated for their comfort, versatility, and impressive ruggedness. They proved so popular, in fact, that soldiers held onto their well-worn pairs even after discharge, and as more and more civilians took notice, the style became a fixture of garages and workshops as well as college campuses and city streets all across the country. Featuring 100% Responsible materials and an updated silhouette, The Foundation Pant is both a reinvention of our earlier chinos and an elevated reimagining of the all-purpose originals, built to help you start your day on solid ground. Because it's been garment dyed and washed, it has the character of a well-loved vintage piece, and it'll continue to pick up a ton of nuance with wear. Cool herringbone accents at the waistband and the pockets serve as a nod to the style's military origins. SPECIFICATIONS Classic medium rise, tailored fit, straight through the thigh with a slight taper from knee to leg opening. Available in 32\" inseam. 8-oz. 100% organic cotton. 5-oz. 100% organic cotton herringbone pocketing. Garment dyed and washed for a vintage feel. Front slash pockets allow easy entry into pockets. Low-profile welt coin pocket inset at waistband. Two back welt pockets. 4-hole vintage military style button at waistband. YKK zipper fly. Bound fly and outseam. Wash cold and tumble dry low. Made in China. Model is 6'1\", wearing a 32.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Ministry of Supply Men's Kinetic Pull-On Pants'\n  - Name='Rhone Commuter Slim Pants'\n  - Name='Pace Women's Cropped Poplin Chino'\n  - Name='UNIQLO Men's Wide Chino Pants'\n  - Name='UNIQLO Men's Ultra Stretch Tall Pants'\n  - Name='Taylor Stitch Men's Organic Cotton Chore Pants in Aged Penny Chipped Canvas'\n  - Name='Ministry of Supply Men's Pace Tapered Chino Pants'\n  - Name='lululemon Men's ABC Classic-Fit 5 Pocket Pant 32L Warpstreme'\n  - Name='Lululemon Men's Ripstop Classic-Fit Pants'\n  - Name='UNIQLO Men's Straight Chino Pants'\n  - Name='Lululemon Men's ABC Classic-Fit 34L Smooth Twill Trousers'\n  - Name='UNIQLO Men's Ultra Stretch Jogger Pants'\n  - Name='Taylor Stitch Men's The Carmel Vacation Pant'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Movement 5-Pocket Pant'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Stretch Terry Indigo 5 Pocket'\n  - Name='Faherty Stretch Terry 5-Pocket Pant'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Stretch Terry 5 Pocket Jeans'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Movement&Trade 5-Pocket Pants'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Movement Linen 5-Pocket Pants'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

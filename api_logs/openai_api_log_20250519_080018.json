    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='TISSOT Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Military Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Automatic Watch with Nylon Strap'\n  - Name='Casio F-91WB Watch'\n  - Name='FS5975 Fossil Mens Defender watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Analog Military Jacket Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PR 100 Sport Chic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex Black Series SRPK43'\n  - Name='Pro Trek Men`s Watch Casio Men's'\n  - Name='Casio Analog Digital Combination Dial Quartz Watch AMW870A-2AV Men's'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Nate Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bronson Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Milatary Hack 3 Hand Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Skagen Estate Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AR0004S30B'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Textile Strap Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

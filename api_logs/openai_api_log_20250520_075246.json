Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='TISSOT Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Military Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Automatic Watch with Nylon Strap'\n  - Name='Casio F-91WB Watch'\n  - Name='FS5975 Fossil Mens Defender watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Analog Military Jacket Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PR 100 Sport Chic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex Black Series SRPK43'\n  - Name='Pro Trek Men`s Watch Casio Men's'\n  - Name='Casio Analog Digital Combination Dial Quartz Watch AMW870A-2AV Men's'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Nate Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bronson Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Milatary Hack 3 Hand Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Skagen Estate Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AR0004S30B'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Textile Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Chronograph Men's Watch CA4500-91'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MDV-107'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0913L19B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0914E19B'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPH31 Blue Dial Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Alpinist Automatic Men's Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

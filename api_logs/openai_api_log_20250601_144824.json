    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Everett Skeleton Leather Black Dial Automatic ME3208 men Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Pilot Pioneer Automatic Swiss Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Open Heart Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin MK2S Watch Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk2i'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Holst Watch SKW2342'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Day-Date Steel Analog Watch MTP1326'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch Edifice ECB-2000CB-2AEF'\n  - Name='SKW6273 Mens Skagen Hagen Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='TW2W74800 Timex Men's Deepwater Reef Watch'\n  - Name='Timex The New Yorker Marlin Hand-Wound 34mm Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Accessories Men's Vintage Self Wind Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Lined Dial Wristwatch'\n  - Name='1976 Kelton Automatic Brown Dial by Timex Watch for Parts & Repair'\n  - Name='Timex Vintage Self Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Early One Automatic Date On 3 Running Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Sub-Dial Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Analog'\n  - Name='Vintage Timex Automatic Watch Lot Of 2'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Timex City Watch TW2V05100'\n  - Name='TW2W47200 Timex Peanuts Marlin Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Gold Tone Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

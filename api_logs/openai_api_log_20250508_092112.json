    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Orient Men's Symphony Automatic Watch RA-AC0F06L10B'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Mechanical Sport Watch'\n  - Name='SEIKO Men's Automatic (Made in Japan) Watch # SNKD97J1'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Mechanical Automatic Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Watch EFR-526L'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Movement Day/Date Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Sutton automatic open heart'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Melbye Multifunction Titanium Watch SKW6078'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Open Heart Watch Automatic'\n  - Name='Tissot Carson Premium Lady Moonphase'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic White Grid Dial Watch SNXF05'\n  - Name='Bulova Surveyor watch 98A284 Men's'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 98A130 Mechanical Automatic Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD51 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Actus Mechanical Automatic Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-5771'\n  - Name='Seiko Watches 7s26-0020 Stainless Steel Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Seiko Series 5 Automatic White Dial Two-tone Watch SNKL84 SNKL84K1'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Auto Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Unisex Automatic Rare Square Face Cross Hair Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Tsuyosa Women's 37mm Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

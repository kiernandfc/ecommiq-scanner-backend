Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Pedal Mafia\"\nReference Product Name: \"Core Jersey White/Black\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe all-new Core Jersey is a high-quality staple for cyclists in pursuit of optimal comfort and durability. Our sustainable manufacturing process has evolved to incorporate recycled yarns, while the ultra-soft knitted fabric provides superior durability and form-fitting compression for all body types. Lightweight construction enhances the freedom of movement, and advanced moisture-wicking technology regulates body temperature during intense rides. With three convenient rear pockets and a zipper-secured storage pocket, youâ€™ll have ample space to stow your riding essentials. Arriving in five new colourways, the reimagined CORE Jersey is a must-have addition to your cycling wardrobe.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Santini Spot Jersey Man'\n  - Name='Santini Tour de France 2024 Torino Classic Cut Short Sleeve Cycling Jersey'\n  - Name='Pedal Mafia Raisin Pro Jersey'\n  - Name='WoPedal Mafia Men's Core Jersey'\n  - Name='Raisin Men's Pro Jersey'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale. Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern. Return the results in the specified JSON format (an object with a 'scores' array, where each item has 'competitor_product_name', 'relevancy_score', and 'rationale' explaining why you assigned that score).\n",

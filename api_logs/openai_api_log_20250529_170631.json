Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field 921980 33mm 1980'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Integra Ignis Military Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H70605163 Steel 42mm 2023'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive One Solar Powered Watch with Crocodile Strap'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Boston Celtics 2024 NBA Champions Supersport Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Southern Miss Golden Eagles Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Marine Black Dial Eco-Drive Men's Watch AW1769-10E'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco-Drive Super Titanium Watch BM7570-80'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Calendrier Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive World Time A-T Radio Controlled Steel Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Oregon Ducks Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Corso Leather Watch'\n  - Name='B Exhibition Citizen Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-drive Solar Radio Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm H70605540 + 5 let záruka a dárek ZDARMA'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H705950 Steel Black 40mm'\n  - Name='BULOVA Men's Snorkel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's St. John Fisher Cardinals Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto H70605540'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Leather Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Men's Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

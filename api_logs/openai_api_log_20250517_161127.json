Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Marine Star Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch Dial'\n  - Name='Bulova Bulova 96A312 Lunar Pilot Meteorite Arch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Lord Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signature Steel-Link Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 55'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Jorn Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Watch'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Eco-Drive Dress/Classic Eco Rolan Mens Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Chronograph White Dial Men's Watch AT8110-53E'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Eco-Drive Sport Luxury PCAT Mens Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Maryland Terrapins Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen AW5005 Military Nylon Strap Eco Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Automatic Sports'\n  - Name='Bulova 96B410 Orologio Uomo Al quarzo'\n  - Name='98A146 Bulova Mens Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Marine Star 96B433 Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Air Force Falcons Watch'\n  - Name='98A302 Marine Star Bulova Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Lunar Pilot'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watches'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

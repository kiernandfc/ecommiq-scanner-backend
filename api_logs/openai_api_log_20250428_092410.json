Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Holst Multi-Function Mesh Band Watch SKW6172'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Recraft Leather Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Pro Trek PRW-6611Y-1ER'\n  - Name='Fossil Mens Easton Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Watch 98B421'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Snorkel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bannon Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 98A179 Classic Automatic Men's 46mm 10ATM'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Icon Polyurethane Strap Luxury Watch 98B152'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Classic Sun and Moon Automatic RA-AS0010S10B'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Black Dial Mens Watch RA-AK0804Y RA-AK0804Y30B'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 7 Pro Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Pro Trek PRW-6900Y'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Watch 98B422'\n  - Name='Men's BQ2666 Fossil Sullivan Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Outlet Men's Privateer Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bronson Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H684811 Steel Black 38mm'\n  - Name='[as-is] Hamilton Khaki Field H644510 40mm Black Dial Qz Day/date Men's'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Lille Three-Hand Rose Gold Stainless Steel Mesh Rectangular Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Standard Analog Stainless Steel Dial Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPJ89 Automatic Green Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Watch SNK809K'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

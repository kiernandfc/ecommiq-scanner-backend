    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Day Date Auto Silver Dial Watch H42525551'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='HAMILTON Khaki Field Officer Auto Watch H706550 44mm Black Dial Wristwatch - ALL Original & Double Box!'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Maquina 98A224 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Banker Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Skeleton Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Open Heart Automatic Black Dial Watch FAG03001B0'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EFV540PB-1A Japanese Automatic Fashion Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Maquina 98a178 46mm Gold-Toned Skeleton Dial Automatic Men's watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Bulova Commodore Automatic Brown Dial Men's Watch 96B324'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Maestro Auto Chrono Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Modern Automatic Watch 98A203'\n  - Name='Bulova Marine Star Men's Automatic 98A272 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sun & Moon Automatic Silver Dial Men's Watch RA-AS0011S10B'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Relic by Fossil Men's Damon Automatic Two-Tone Alloy Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Le Locle Automatic Lady Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch Edifice'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton American Classic Railroad Small Second Auto'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Navy BeLOWZERO Auto'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bannon Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Maquina Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AG0027Y10B'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

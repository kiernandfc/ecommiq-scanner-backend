    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Heritage Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage Women's Automatic Diamond Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Ocw-t200s Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Promaster Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman ME3098 Brown Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice EFB700D Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02562-43 Black 42mm 2021'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 3'\n  - Name='Casio Puredial Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice EF-121D-1AVEG Quartz'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Stopwatch 100M Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 2S Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivofit Jr. Activity Tracker'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S20 Activity Gps Golf Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivoactive 5 Blue Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct Rugged Activity Tracker'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Golfer'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Blue Dial Mesh Band Quartz Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02839-50 35.4mm 2024'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Automatic SNXS80 Watch SNXS80K1'\n  - Name='Casio Men's EF305-1AV Edifice Multifunction Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Automatic Mechanical Tourbillon Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Gw-9400BJ Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

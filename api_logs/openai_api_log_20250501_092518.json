Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Q Falcon Eye Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Ironman T200 42mm Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG31 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='SRPJ37 Seiko Men's 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Classic 40mm Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Sports Style'\n  - Name='Fossil Unisex Marvel x Limited Edition Automatic Red and'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Race Quartz Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='watch Tissot Men's Seastar 1000 Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='Casio Men's ProTrek 340 Solar Watch PRG340SC'\n  - Name='Casio Watch AQ-800E'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Tsuyosa Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Sports / Flight Watch Green Black 42mm Field Men’s'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex U.s.

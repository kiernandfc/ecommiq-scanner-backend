Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

    "system_prompt": "You are an AI assistant evaluating product relevancy.\nYour goal is to determine how relevant a list of competitor products are to a specific reference product, based on names and descriptions.\nOutput the scores as a JSON object containing a single key 'scores', which is an array of objects. Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

It’s a deep rooted city that is built upon loyalty. The black shamrock is a subtle yet strong touch to this six panel scally cap.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Carhartt WIP Mens Script Cap'\n  - Name='Goorin Bros. Wool Newsboy Hat'\n  - Name='Goorin Bros. Plaid Flat Cap'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale. Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern. Return the results in the specified JSON format (an object with a 'scores' array, where each item has 'competitor_product_name', 'relevancy_score', and 'rationale' explaining why you assigned that score).\n",

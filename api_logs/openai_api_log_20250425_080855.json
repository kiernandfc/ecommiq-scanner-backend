Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Watch fs6085'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Titanium Auto'\n  - Name='H69439131 Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Precisionist Champlain Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Titanium Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Mako Solar Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Sol Solar-Powered Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's CB0166-54H World Perpetual A-T'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPD73K2 Black Dial Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SSK003 Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Street Style Automatic SSK025'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Men's SPB243'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports RPJ81'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Women's Digital Sports Watch with 60-Lap Memory'\n  - Name='CASIO Vintage Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Kamasu Mako III Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Auto Day Date'\n  - Name='Skagen Fisk Titanium Limited Edition Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Series'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Five 5 Overseas Model Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Essentials Core Sur553 Classic Analog Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Men's Field Gear Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

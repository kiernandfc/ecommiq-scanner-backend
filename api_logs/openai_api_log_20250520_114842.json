Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Outlet Men's Privateer Chronograph'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Columbia University Machine Smoke Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Neutra Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Promaster Tough Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Vintage Army Sergeant Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Classic 40mm Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Auburn Tigers Machine Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Modern Sophisticate Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Calendrier Watch BU2020-29X'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Enticer World Time Telememo Analog Digital Watch AMW-880D-1A'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Neutra Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Battery Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's East Stroudsburg Warriors Machine Smoke Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Strap'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Bracelet Watch AT2520-89'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Orient RA-AC0K Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='FOSSIL For Ladies Model WB-1060 Quartz Movement'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Sloan Gold Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Colorado Buffaloes Blue Dive Three-Hand Date Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Taylor Stitch\"\nReference Product Name: \"The Democratic Chino\"\nReference Product Description:\nOriginally issued to American soldiers during WWII, the first military chinos were celebrated for their comfort, versatility, and impressive ruggedness. They proved so popular, in fact, that soldiers held onto their well-worn pairs even after discharge, and as more and more civilians took notice, the style became a fixture of garages and workshops as well as college campuses and city streets all across the country. Featuring 100% Responsible materials and an updated silhouette, The Foundation Pant is both a reinvention of our earlier chinos and an elevated reimagining of the all-purpose originals, built to help you start your day on solid ground. Because it's been garment dyed and washed, it has the character of a well-loved vintage piece, and it'll continue to pick up a ton of nuance with wear. Cool herringbone accents at the waistband and the pockets serve as a nod to the style's military origins. SPECIFICATIONS Classic medium rise, tailored fit, straight through the thigh with a slight taper from knee to leg opening. Available in 32\" inseam. 8-oz. 100% organic cotton. 5-oz. 100% organic cotton herringbone pocketing. Garment dyed and washed for a vintage feel. Front slash pockets allow easy entry into pockets. Low-profile welt coin pocket inset at waistband. Two back welt pockets. 4-hole vintage military style button at waistband. YKK zipper fly. Bound fly and outseam. Wash cold and tumble dry low. Made in China. Model is 6'1\", wearing a 32.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Everlane Chinos & Khakis Pants'\n  - Name='Ministry of Supply Men's Kinetic Tapered Pants'\n  - Name='Lululemon Men's Commission Classic-Fit Shorts in Warpstreme'\n  - Name='Lululemon Men's ABC Slim-Fit Stretch Cotton Trousers'\n  - Name='Lululemon Men's ABC Warpstreme Slim-Fit Pull-On Pants'\n  - Name='lululemon Men's ABC Warpstreme Pull-On Pant Regular'\n  - Name='Men's Taylor Stitch The Democratic Foundation Pant'\n  - Name='Faherty Coastline Stretch Chino'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Essential Chino Shorts'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Movement Linen 5-Pocket Pants'\n  - Name='Faherty Stretch Terry 5-Pocket Athletic Fit Pant'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

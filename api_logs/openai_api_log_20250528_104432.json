    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 570'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Q Timex 1978 Day/Date TW2W44700'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Jazzmaster Thinline Auto H38525541'\n  - Name='Casio Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPE99 Prospex Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Automatic'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Sea Automatic Dial Men's Watch NY0040'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Titanium Auto Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Accessories Grant Twist Automatic Multifunction Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Mechanical Automatic Green Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's ME3111 Grant Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Automatic Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Skeleton Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Men's Slip-Thru Watch with Adjustable Strap'\n  - Name='Fossil Forrester Skeleton Watch Blue Dial Automatic Men's Watch Me3154'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Marine Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Water Resistant'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Heritage Skeleton Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3 Dive Computer'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='TW2V42400 Timex Mens Waterbury Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Waterbury Classic Automatic Men's Watch TW2T70000'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Silver Dial Mens Watch TW2V61900V3'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Watches H246551 Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Jazzmaster Performer Auto Chrono'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman ME3075 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mechanical Automatic Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Men's Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Maestro Automatic Watch with Calfskin Leather Dial'\n  - Name='Skagen Grenen Solar-Powered Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SSK037 Presage Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Tsuyosa Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Automatic Winding Mechanical Analog'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Automatic Dial Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK Full Metal Men's'\n  - Name='Citizen Elegance Mens Automatic NH9131'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field King Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Arabic Numerals'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton American Classic Pan Europ Auto Day Date'\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Viewmatic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

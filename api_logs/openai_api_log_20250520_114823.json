Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Black Strap Watch Aw0115-03e'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Military Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin vivomove Trend Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Fossil Steel Battery Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Brenton Automatic Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Luther Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Rye Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='FS5920 Fossil Men's Machine Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive BM8476-23E Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Q&q Analog Field Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Chandler Eco-Drive Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Quartz Watch,Two-Tone Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco Drive Military Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Watch Promaster Land CB5921-59X'\n  - Name='Drive Citizen Men's Eco Drive Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Lineage Watch LCW-M170'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's The Wizard of oz Limited Edition Three-Hand Crystal Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Brynn Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Niagara Falls Culinary Institute Machine Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Virginia Tech Hokies Everett Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex 1983 Reissue Automatic TW2Y07300'\n  - Name='Timex GMT Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's MK1 Automatic Watch with Fabric Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Open Heart Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Men's Watch EFV-610D'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPH87 Essentials Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Edifice EFV620D-1A'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's NY0150-51A Promaster Dive Automatic White'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SNKL45 Watch SNKL50'\n  - Name='Casio Model Number OCW-G1200-2AJF Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Lille Two-Hand Watch'\n  - Name='Men Bulova Watches 96A281'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage SARX045 Mechanical Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Cocktail Time SSA459'\n  - Name='Men's Casio EFV-560D Edifice'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0004E19B'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Railroad Swiss Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation X-Wind Auto'\n  - Name='Orient Defender Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Starfish Classic Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Samso Series Three-Hand Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Ancher Mono Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Pan- Europ 1971 Tribute Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Ironman Adrenaline Ana-Digi Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Q Timex 1972 Reissue Men's Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch LF30W'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Air Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Freja Two-Tone Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Anita Lille Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Denmark Women's Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Unisex 100 Meters Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 945'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-M305'\n  - Name='BQ2426 Men's Fossil Privateer Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Women's 60-Lap Memory Digital Watch LWS1200H'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Hagen Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen skw2210'\n  - Name='Skagen Denmark Women 922ssss Mother Of Pearl Dial Steel Mesh Quartz'\n  - Name='Tissot Mod.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Townsman Brown Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Multi-Year Calendar Watch feu00002'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino RA-AP0105Y30B Automatic'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Jorn Black Dial Watch SKW6422'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 9 Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signature Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 265S'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signature Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AC0F06L10B'\n  - Name='Orient Mens Bambino Automatic RA-AP0101B30B Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Bambino Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Ballade Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Japanese Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Men's Automatic Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Multi-Year Calendar Automatic RA-BA0006B10B Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Day Date Auto Watch H70535031'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Autocross Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0K01B10B'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Dive Automatic NB6005-05L Men's'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPJ81 Automatic Water Resistant Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports “SNXS Series” Automatic'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Mechanical Eagle Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

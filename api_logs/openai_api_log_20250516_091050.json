Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Weekender Quartz White Dial Unisex Watch TW2W'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Ridge Mens Watch TW2W16300'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Metal Tech Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Skagen Mens Holst Gray Dial Blue Band Casual Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen SKW6266 Holst Chronograph Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive PCAT Chronograph Gold Tone Watch CB5912-50E'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco Drive Brown Leather Chandler Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Lunar Pilot Chronograph 96B251'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3i Dive Computer'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H69401140 Steel Blue 38mm 2025'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3 50mm Solar'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H70225540 2025'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mecha Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Manual Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Damian Lillard Special Edition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='SRPK17 Seiko 5 Sports 55th Anniversary Limited Edition'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPJ47'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Solar Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='SRPJ09 Seiko Men's 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex 2007 Diver Automatic SPB103'\n  - Name='Seiko SSJ015J1 Astron GPS Solar Jet'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

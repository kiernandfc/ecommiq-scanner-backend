    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Automatic 1983 E Line'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Metropolitan Automatic Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Field Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Automatic Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SNXS Automatic Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 3 Fitness and Health Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Automatic Swiss Made Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02863-90 50mm 2023'\n  - Name='Seiko Seiko Series 5 Automatic White Dial Men's Watch SNKL47 SNKL47K1'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 SKX Automatic Men's Sports Special Edition SRPK13K1'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Cocktail Time SRPK15'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex SBDC147 Alpinist Automatic Mechanical Men's Watch Made in Japan'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage SRPF53'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD65 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch 98A203'\n  - Name='Garmin Women's Instinct 2Xsolar 50Mm Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin 45mm Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin vivoactive 6 GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02626-40 2022'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivoactive 5 Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin epix Pro Gen 2 GPS Outdoor Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

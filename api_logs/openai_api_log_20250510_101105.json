Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco-Drive Star Wars Han Solo'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Missouri Western State Griffons Minimalist Slim Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Watch Eco Drive BM7480-81E'\n  - Name='Branded Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Luxury Eco-Drive Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Marquette Golden Eagles Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Military Hack Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Del Rey Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Clemson Tigers Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Drive AR Watch AW1158-05L'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Gents Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Automatic Watch RA-AA0C02L19B'\n  - Name='Skagen GRENEN SKW6387 TITANIUM MESH BAND MILITARY FIELD MEN'S WATCH NEW BATTERY - Men | Color: Gray/White | Size: s'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 8 Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 8 Solar'\n  - Name='Seiko MECHANICAL Dress Line SZSB012 Automatic Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Blue Watch SNZG11'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPK29 Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='The CITIZEN Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Saginaw Valley State Cardinals Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Tachymeter Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's 50m Black Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dean Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

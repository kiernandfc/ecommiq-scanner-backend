Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Men's SPB155'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Solar Powered Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical H694390 Steel Black 38mm'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Frogman Automatic'\n  - Name='Garmin Tactix Charlie- Saphire 51mm'\n  - Name='Garmin Toughness Gps Outdoor Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's STRetto Solar Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1302P'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SS Green Dial NATO Band'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H69429931 Analog Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct'\n  - Name='Orient Classic Solar-Powered Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Military Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Blue Dial Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko Prospex SRPH17'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Radio Sync Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field GMT Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPJ85'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct Rugged Outdoor Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Quartz Analog Watch with Leather Band'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Sport Wristwatch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

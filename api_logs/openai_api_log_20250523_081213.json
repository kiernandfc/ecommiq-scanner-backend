    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EFB700D Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Men's Solar Powered Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock MTP-V004D-7B'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino RA-AP0104S30B Automatic'\n  - Name='Citizen Collection Mechanical Classic Day & Date Black NY4050-62E'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Watch 96B429'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Freja Two-Tone Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Jorn Black Dial Watch SKW6422'\n  - Name='Orient Kamasu Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0001B19B'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Blue Dial Watch RA-AC0M10L RA-AC0M10L30B'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Officer Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino Automatic RA-AC0P04Y10B Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Men's Tsuyosa Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Seiko 5 Automatic Gold Dial Stainless Steel Men's Watch SNKK29 SNKK29K1'\n  - Name='Skagen Mens Holst Gray Dial Blue Band Casual Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Zenshin Super Titanium Men's Watch Automatic NJ0180-80'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED Sapphire'\n  - Name='Timex Men's M79 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Calf Leather'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Peanuts Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Dial Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

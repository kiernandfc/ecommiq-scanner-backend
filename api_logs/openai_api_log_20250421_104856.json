    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Navi XL Dive Automatic Rubber Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Tsuyosa Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch Octava Automatic Crystal'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Valiant Auto'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Automatic Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch SRPK67'\n  - Name='Citizen Elegance Mens Automatic NH9131'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Automatic Mechanical White Dial JDM SARB035'\n  - Name='Casio Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton American Classic Boulton Men's Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster 40mm Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signatur Sport Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's C7 Automatic NH8391-51Z'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Neutra Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Modern Machine Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch Edifice Men's EFR-571D-1AVUEF'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Blue Angels World Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Mod Daydate Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sport Automatic Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Diver Analog Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

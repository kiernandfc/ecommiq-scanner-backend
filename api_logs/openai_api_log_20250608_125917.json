Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Taylor Stitch\"\nReference Product Name: \"The Ojai Jacket\"\nReference Product Description:\nWith its classic French chore coat silhouette that’s easy to dress up or down and an abundance of utility-focused features, it’s no wonder why The Ojai has become one of our most popular designs ever. This iteration is rendered in an organic cotton twill that’s reverse-engineered from deadstock military fabric, so it’ll stand up to years of hard wear and pick up incredible character along the way.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='J.Crew Men's Limited-Edition Wallace & Barnes Italian Suede Work Jacket'\n  - Name='Wallace & Barnes By J. Crew Chore Jacket'\n  - Name='Filson Men's Ranger Insulated Anorak Jacket'\n  - Name='Women Carhartt WIP OG Michigan Coat'\n  - Name='Filson Chore Jacket'\n  - Name='Filson Men's Deer Island Ranch Coat'\n  - Name='Norse Projects Erik Donegal Diamond Jacket'\n  - Name='Norse Projects Standard Twill Overshirt'\n  - Name='Levi's Men's Cotton Trucker Jacket'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale. Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern. Return the results in the specified JSON format (an object with a 'scores' array, where each item has 'competitor_product_name', 'relevancy_score', and 'rationale' explaining why you assigned that score).\n",

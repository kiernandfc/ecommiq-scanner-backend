    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Automatic'\n  - Name='Timex Watch Deepwater Reef 200 men'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Women's 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Women's Blue Dial Watch SRE003K1'\n  - Name='Orient Multi-Year Calendar Automatic Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Two-Hand Skeleton Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Vivomove HR'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPH85 Essentials Automatic Silver Dial Bracelet Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's'\n  - Name='Seiko Automatic'\n  - Name='SEIKO Selection SARV001 Automatic Mechanical Men's Watch DHL'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar 1000 Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako 40 Watch RA-AC0Q01B10B'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Classic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5 Plus'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's H24555331 Ventura Elvis80 Automatic'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5X Plus Sapphire'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Men's SNKE56 SNKE56 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Gold Dial Ladies Watch SYMA38K1'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice Sospensione EQS960'\n  - Name='Casio Oceanus Manta Radio Men's Wave Solar'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Mudmaster Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

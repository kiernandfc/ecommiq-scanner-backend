    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 255'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's PRX POWERMATIC 80 WATCH'\n  - Name='Wearable4u Garmin Forerunner 55 Gps Running 42 Mm Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Skeleton Back Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Intra-Matic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 7 Solar - Smart Sports Watch, Titanium Slate Gray'\n  - Name='Skagen Ex Auto Winding J755xlblb Date'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Mellem Lille'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 2 Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct E 40mm Rugged Outdoor GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct E GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 55'\n  - Name='Garmin Gold And Cream Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 3'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 970 GPS Running Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2 GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02645-61 2022'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02891-41 38mm 2024'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's 570stlb All Titanium Mop Face Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signatur Analogue Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Watch Hagen White Dial Plated Stainless Steel Bracelet'\n  - Name='Skagen stainless steel skw3156'\n  - Name='TISSOT Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Men's Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

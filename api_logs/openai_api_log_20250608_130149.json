Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Sutton Automatic Open Aperture Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Maquina Black Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Ord Corps 10ak Us Military Issued Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Flieger SRPH29K1 SRPH29 SRPH29K Green Nylon Mechanical Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Protrek'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco-Drive Super Titanium watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-SHOCK Watch'\n  - Name='Field Watch Citizen Eco Drive'\n  - Name='Citizen Mens Eco-Drive Sport BM7631-52'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Officer Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Pioneer H60416583'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 945'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 735XT'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5 Plus'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S10 Golf Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 245 Music'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix Chronos w Band 010-01957-02'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5S Plus'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Sutton Chronograph Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Bulova Georgia Tech Classic Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military Type Running Swiss Cal.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Mens Seiko 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio MTP Watch MTP-1375PD'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Chronograph Grant Black Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bronson Automatic Brown Litehide Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic 3ATM Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Automatic Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Regatta Automatic Stainless Steel Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation Black Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Quartz Watch H68401735'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Contemporary RA-AA0C03S19B Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PR 100 Jungfraubahn Quartz 34mm'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Aviator'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2 Solar Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2X Solar Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin fēnix 7 Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2'\n  - Name='Garmin Tactix 7 Pro GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 8 GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 7S Pro Sapphire Solar Multisport GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's 833XLSSN1 Denmark Blue Dial Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Carson Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream Swissmatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Desir Powermatic 80 Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Everytime Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AA0C Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen 922SRRR Mop Dial Rose Gold Stainless Steel Mesh Women`s Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Lille Two-Hand Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Freja SKW2699 Two-Tone Silver Quartz Ladies Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Avion Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD55 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Rosegold Stainless Steel Analog Quartz Watch, Gold'\n  - Name='Skagen Anita Crystal Index Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Gitte Mesh Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Slim Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Freja Analogue Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Steel Watch with Black Bezel and Mesh Bracelet'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Anita Strap Quartz Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Signatur Steel-Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Steel Black Dial Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Skagen Two-Tone Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women Freja Stainless Steel-Mesh Watch Silver - One size'\n  - Name='Garmin Lily 2 Active Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 165 Music'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

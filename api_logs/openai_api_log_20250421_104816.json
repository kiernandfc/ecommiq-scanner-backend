    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Classic Watch BU2112-06E'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Recraft Leather Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Watch Automaticos RA-AK0802S30B Men's Bambino'\n  - Name='Hamilton American Classic Intra-Matic Auto Men's'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Holst Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Symphony III Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3i Dive Computer'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's PR516 Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's \"Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Black Carbon Fiber Dial Titanium Men's Watch 234XXLT'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Alpinist SPB121'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Stainless Steel/Leather'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic x Peanuts Men's Take Care TW2V32600'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Peanuts Snoopy Flying Ace Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Titanium Automatic 41mm Watch'\n  - Name='Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel Bracelet Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic 40mm Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Metropolitan Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Giorgio Galli S2Ti Swiss Automatic Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Navi XL Automatic Leather Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

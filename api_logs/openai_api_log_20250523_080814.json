Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Orient Men's Analog Metal Band Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Capital Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Analog Automatic Casual Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Analog Automatic Casual Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Three Star Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version Iii Japanese Automatic Hand-Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 570'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SGEG21 Classic Stainless Steel Casual Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Frank Lloyd Wright Hollyhock House Men's Watch 96A286'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage Classics SPB463J1 Men's'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-M305'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

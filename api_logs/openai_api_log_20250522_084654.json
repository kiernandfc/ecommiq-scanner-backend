    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's M79'\n  - Name='TIMEX Marlin 40mm men Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North with Sapphire Crystal'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 570'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Watch 96B429'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Blue Dial Watch RA-AC0M10L RA-AC0M10L30B'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='G Men's- Shock MT-G MTGB2000YR1A Watch By Casio'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Mechanical Movement Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient RA-AS0103A10B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sport Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Freja watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PRX Powermatic 80 Steel & 18K Gold Bezel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Mechanical Open Heart Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's 1977 Day Date Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Running Day/Date Dial'\n  - Name='Timex Women's Waterbury Automatic Pearl Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Viscount'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Date Indicator Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Vintage Leather Arabic Numerals UFO Non Running'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Self-winding Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

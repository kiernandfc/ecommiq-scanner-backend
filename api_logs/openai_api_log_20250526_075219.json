    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Field Post Solar Waterproof Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic 21 Jewels SNKL41 SNKL41J1 Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Watch AEQ-120W'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRS 516 Powermatic 80 Automatic Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage Visodate Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Mens Ancher Titanium & Stainless Steel Watch SKW6432'\n  - Name='Skagen Melbye Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Mens Series 8 Automatic NB6050-51W Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Elegance Mens Automatic NH9131'\n  - Name='SEIKO Men's 5 Automatic winding SNKE03K1'\n  - Name='Men Tissot T-Race Swissmatic'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Carson 30mm Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's 3 Star Stainless Steel Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Men's Watch RA-AS0102S10B'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Lord Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Gentleman Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='SNK357 Seiko 5 Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Prs516 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Chemin Des Tourelles Squelette'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Navigator Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

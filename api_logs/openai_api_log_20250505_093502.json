    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Weekender Slip-Thru Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Deepwater Reef 200 men'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Traprock Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Watch with Telememo'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Promaster LAND Series Direct Flight Eco Drive Radio Watch CB5036-10X'\n  - Name='Bulova Vintage 1950 Manual Wind Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sport 3-Hand Analog Watch'\n  - Name='BQ2426 Men's Fossil Privateer Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Veloci-T Automatic'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Veloci-T Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRC 100 Solar Quartz watch'\n  - Name='Men Tissot T-Race Swissmatic'\n  - Name='Orient Envoy Version 2 Automatic Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 96B015 Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Armbanduhr Herren FUG1X004D9'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch 97D108'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR 100 Stainless Steel Watch T0494101104701'\n  - Name='Tissot Gent XL Swissmatic Men's'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's A-11 Military Manual Wind'\n  - Name='Bulova Rider Broncs Two-Tone Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

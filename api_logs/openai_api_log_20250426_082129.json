    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Denmark Men's Quartz Analog Movement Wrist'\n  - Name='Skagen Ancher Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Lille Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signature Quartz Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Supersport Chrono Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's 2nd Generation Bambino Automatic Watch FAC00004B0'\n  - Name='Orient Orient Automatic Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0B01G'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Vintage 1970s Automatic Self Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Peanuts Snoopy Flying Ace Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Round Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex UFC Pro Automatic Men's Watch with Silicone Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Ladies Waterbury Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Mens M79 Automatic Bracelet Watch TW2U83400'\n  - Name='Timex Waterbury TW2V24900'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Waterbury Automatic Leather Strap Watch TW2V24800'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Date Silver Watch1'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Peanuts Gang's All Here Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's TW2V62000U9 Round Dial Mechanical Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Timex 41mm Deepwater Reef Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Accessories Self-Wind Vintage Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Auto Day Date'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Scuba Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

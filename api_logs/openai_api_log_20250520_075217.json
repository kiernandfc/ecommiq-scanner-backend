Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch North Field Post'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Metal Field Full-Size Watch with Brown Leather'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Field Post Solar Waterproof Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch TW4B23000'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Solar Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Men's T49905 Timex Expedition Field Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil FS5751 Gents Watch - Latitude'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD65 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='FS4835 Men's Fossil Grant Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bronson Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Windfield Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Black Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-M305'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's SKW6360 Stainless Steel Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Chronograph Eco-Drive Black Watch CA4505-80L'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Navihawk Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Series8 890 Automatic Men's Watch NB6060-58L'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Navihawk A-T AT8227-56X'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Tough'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Watch 96B429'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SRPD76K1'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Wilton Automatic Watch 43mm 96A217'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Le Locle Automatic watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage Visodate Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Mechanical Calf Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Sport Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Diver-Style Stainless Steel Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Singapore MTP-V006D-1C'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Gentleman Powermatic 80 Silicium 18K'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Heritage 1938 Automatic COSC Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Ancher Skeleton Automatic Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 165 Music'\n  - Name='Orient Men's FAC00003W0 Bambino 2nd Generation Automatic'\n  - Name='HAMILTON Men's Khaki Navy Scuba Auto'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 55'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Blue Nylon Strap Watch SRPE63'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PR 100 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Gentleman Powermatic 80 Silicium Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Gentleman Powermatic 80 Silicium Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's AQ-230GA-5AMQYES Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

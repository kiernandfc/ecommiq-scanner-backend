    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Viewmatic Auto H42725551'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Skeleton Lady Auto Watch H32265101'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch Oceanographer 96B405 GMT'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Broadway Day Date Auto Watch H43515135'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Analogue Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Scuba Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Wilton Watch 96A218'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Automatic Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto Watches'\n  - Name='HAMILTON Men's Jazzmaster Viewmatic Auto'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako 75th Anniversary Automatic Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Descent Mk3i Dive Computer'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Bambino 2nd Generation Automatic FAC0000'\n  - Name='Garmin Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SPB249 Prospex Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Stauer Automatic Gold-Finished Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Hagen (36mm) Black Dial / Black PVD Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen LTD Men's SGLJ Automatic Movement Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR516 Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Riis Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Anw Skagen Men's Ex Collaboration Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Signatur Watch SKW6376'\n  - Name='Skagen Br Belt Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

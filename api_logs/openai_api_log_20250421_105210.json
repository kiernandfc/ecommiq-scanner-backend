    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph FS4656 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Mako III Automatic RA-AA0003R19B Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Coachman Chronograph Leather Watch CH2565'\n  - Name='Orient Sport Solar Brown Dial Men's Watch RA-WJ0004Y10B'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports “SNXS Series” Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Sport Solar Green Dial Mens Watch RA-WJ0001E10B'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Black Label 531XLSXM1 Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Heritage Chronograph Watch TW2Y24000'\n  - Name='Timex Women's Expedition Field Watch TW4B11900'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Traprock 43mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Expedition North Sierra TW2V22800'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's King Khaki Field Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Waterbury Heritage Chronograph Watch TW2Y19300-OS'\n  - Name='Timex Archive MK-1 Hand Wind'\n  - Name='Timex Men's World Time Reissue Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Stainless Steel Bracelet Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Kanno Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0008B'\n  - Name='Orient Armbanduhr Damen RA-AG0019B10B'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Titanium Automatic 41mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Resin Combo'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Metropolitan Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Leather Watch T49870'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

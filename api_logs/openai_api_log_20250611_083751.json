    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Classic Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic 1983 E Line'\n  - Name='Seiko Mod Daydate Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio G-Shock'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Automatic Black Dial Watch ME3207'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Open Heart Automatic Men's Watch H32705181'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino Sun & Moon Automatic Watch RA-AK0801S30B'\n  - Name='Orient Ray II Automatic 200m FAA02004B9 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Hagen Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Mechanical Open Heart Stainless Steel NB4024-95A Men's 100M Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Oceanographer GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Stainless Steel Dial Analog Digital Dual Time Zone Watch MTP-VC01D-1E Men's'\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AR0202E10B Retro Future Camera'\n  - Name='Tissot Gentleman Automatic Black Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5S'\n  - Name='Orient Mako II Automatic Diver's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's FAL00002B0 Classic Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG41 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Ballade Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

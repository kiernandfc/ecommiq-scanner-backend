Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Hagen Watch SKW7604'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Hagen (36mm) Green Rectangular Dial / Brown Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Watches Kamasu V2 Graduate 42 Mm 手表 RA-AA0811E-OS'\n  - Name='Skagen stainless steel mesh skw3080'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 3S'\n  - Name='Garmin epix'\n  - Name='Skagen stainless steel skw3147'\n  - Name='Orient Mako Chronograph 光動能潛水錶 RA-TX0206L • 天藍色'\n  - Name='Tissot Gent XL'\n  - Name='Herren Tissot Heritage Petite Seconde T119.405.16.037'\n  - Name='Tissot Heritage 1948'\n  - Name='Tissot PRC 200 Chronograph T055.417.11.047.00'\n  - Name='Tissot Heritage Navigator 160th Anniversary Automatic'\n  - Name='Tissot T-NAVIGATOR Chrono C01 Stahl/k T062.427.17.057.00'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Horloge GA-700HDS-7A by CASIO | Wit/Blauw, lichtblauw'\n  - Name='Casio Pro Trek PRW-6621Y-1ER Heren'\n  - Name='CASIO Timeless Collection Horloge AE-1000W-5AV | Zwart'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Horloge GW-5000HS-7 by CASIO | Wit'\n  - Name='Casio PAW1100-1V heren horloge 52 mm'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Horloge GM-S5600U-1 by CASIO | Zilver'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Horloge GBA-950-7A by CASIO | Wit'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK Horloge GMW-B5000D-1 by CASIO | Zilver'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Heren EFV-640D'\n  - Name='Casio Horloge Heren Edifice'\n  - Name='Relógio FOSSIL Fs5525'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

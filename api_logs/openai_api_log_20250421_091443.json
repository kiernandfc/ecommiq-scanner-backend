    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Accessories Men's Big Beautiful Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Automatic Sutton Black Leather Strap Watch 43mm'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Powermatic 80 Steel & 18K Gold Diamond Bezel'\n  - Name='Orient Kamasu Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0002L19B'\n  - Name='Hamilton Railroad Skeleton Men's Watch H40655131'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Titanium Auto 42mm Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Standard Stainless Steel Dial Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Sutton Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation X-Wind Chrono Auto'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Valiant Auto H39525214'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Waterproof Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 2 Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Millennia Black Ceramic Automatic Watch 98A291'\n  - Name='Orient Ray Raven II Automatic 200m FAA02003B9 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EFR-552'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Open Heart Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Railroad Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Day Date'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic 10K Rgp Round Day N Date Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

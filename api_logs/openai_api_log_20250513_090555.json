Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 7 Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Orient Star Avant-Gard Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RE-AV0A01B00B, Automatic Movement, Stainless Steel Strap, 43.2 mm Case in Black'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Men's Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='ORIENT BAMBINO IV COLLECTION'\n  - Name='Orient Star Automatic Green Mother of Pearl Dial Mens Watch RE-BY0005A00B'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Contemporary RA-AA0C03S19B Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex'\n  - Name='Casio Overland Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Core Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Mens TAC00008W0 Watch'\n  - Name='ORIENT SPORTS Automatic WV0011AA'\n  - Name='Orient Classic Manual Wind Skeleton Dial Watch RE-AZ0004S00B'\n  - Name='Orient Star Contemporary Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Two-Hand Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's World Map Watch Automatic RA-AA0E03L19B'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Black Series Limited Edition SRPH99'\n  - Name='Orient RA-AC0M12L30B'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino Automatic RA-AC0P03L10B Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

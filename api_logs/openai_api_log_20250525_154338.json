Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Field Chronograph Men's Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Men's Solar Analog Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Ladies Essentials SUR413 Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Automatic SRPB77'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Field Gear V33f-6a80'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Gmt Field Series'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Stainless Steel Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen PCAT Strap Watch CB5919-00X'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Checkered Flag Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster JV1005-02W Men's Eco-Drive Land Series'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Heavy Duty Analog & Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino RA-AC0P01E10B Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Military Field Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1302P'\n  - Name='Seiko Mod Custom Hand-Built Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Core SRPF94 Seiko 5'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG31 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPJ85 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition North Tide-Temp-Compass Watch TW2V03900'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Timex Waterbury Traditional GMT Quartz Black Dial Watch TW2W22800'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1302P'\n  - Name='Orient Classic Solar-Powered Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Q&q Falcon Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPD89'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Bracelet Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK Full Metal Men's'\n  - Name='Citizen BJ7100'\n  - Name='Citizen NJ0190-51 Steel'\n  - Name='Casio G Men's-shock Mr-g MRGB2100 Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch LWS-2200H'\n  - Name='G-shock Men's 59mm Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='HAMILTON Men's Khaki Navy Scuba Auto'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Chronograph Date Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation Pilot Chrono Quartz'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's SKW6053 Quartz Mesh Band Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H69439111 Steel White 38mm 2022'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Frogman Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Men's'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Date Field Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Navy Frogman Auto'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Sport Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

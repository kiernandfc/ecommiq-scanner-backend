Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

Our Incognito Dress Socks are a 60-second style upgrade. For weddings, formal events or everyday wear, add these affordable dress socks to instantly dress up any look. The light blue background announces warmer weather has arrived, while the abstract floral pattern gets extra mileage as it can look like trend-forward camouflage or subtle tie dye. Need a hand completing the look? Our stylist suggests wearing these dress with a bright blue denim suit and tan suede lace-ups.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Charles Tyrwhitt Men's Rib Socks'\n  - Name='Sock Genius Downey Carded Cotton Socks'\n  - Name='OTAA Men's Happy Penguin Socks'\n  - Name='OTAA Men's Low Cut Dot Socks'\n  - Name='OTAA Men's Textured Cotton-blend Socks'\n  - Name='Jos.

Remember to focus on product features, silhouette, and construction rather than color or pattern.

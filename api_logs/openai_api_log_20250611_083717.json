Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Lunar Pilot Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Murph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Geo Trekker Eco Men's Watch BY3006-53H'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Three-Hand Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Multi Dial Men's 'Tsuki-yomi' Watch BY1010-81'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical H69439131 Steel Black 38mm 2025'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Mechanical Watch with See Through Back'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Blue Dial | King Jewelers'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Anita Mesh Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Corso Watch BM7103-51L'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Lunar Pilot 98K112 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Everytime Lady Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Accessories | Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical H694390 Hand Winding Men's Watch_861995 | Color: Black/Red | Size: Os | Luxestash's Closet'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Aviation Converter Chrono Auto Men's'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-Shock Women's'\n  - Name='G-Shock Casio GA100 Custom Analog Digital Military Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Rangeman Solar A'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Sport Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='G-SHOCK CASIO Watch GST-W330AC-2A G-STEEL Mid-size Radio Solar Double LED Light Tough Leather Band CORDURA Fabric Metal Forged Bezel Military Navy ...'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Military Cloth Band Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Pro-Trek Watch PRG-340'\n  - Name='Casio Pro Trek Rubber Band'\n  - Name='SEIKO Men's 5 Automatic Winding SNKE03K1'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock G-2900 Digital Military Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Start Stop Iluminator'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic SRPE'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock GW-M5610U-1'\n  - Name='Fossil Mens Brox Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Baby-G Retro Flower Field Digital Strap Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Collection'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch W-59-1VQES Men's'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Rolan Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Garrett FS5625 Quartz Chronograph Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Sky Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Privateer Sport Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

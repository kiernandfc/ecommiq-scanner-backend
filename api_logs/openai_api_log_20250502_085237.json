Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

This iteration is rendered in an organic cotton twill that’s reverse-engineered from deadstock military fabric, so it’ll stand up to years of hard wear and pick up incredible character along the way.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Universal Works Men's N1 Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works - stripe-embellished bomber jacket - men - Cotton/Recycled Polyamide - XL - Neutrals'\n  - Name='Universal Works Men's Light Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works Men's Tweed Top Coat'\n  - Name='Universal Works Boston Parka'\n  - Name='Universal Works Men's Tyler Organic Cotton Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works Men's Pembroke Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works Men's Parachute Field Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works Zipped Bomber jacket men'\n  - Name='Universal Works Bakers Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works Selvage Denim Backers Jacket'\n  - Name='Universal Works Two Button Jacket - Grey - 2XL - Men'\n  - Name='Universal Works Denim Three Button Jacket'\n  - Name='Faherty Men's Denim Studio Jacket'\n  - Name='Barbour Utility Chore Jacket'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Wakefield Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Rolan Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Townsman Brown Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AA0001B19B'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signatur Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Mod Daydate Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Flynn Automatic Skeleton Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's American Clipper Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Mens Edifice EFR-575'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Scuba Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Kulor Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Viewmatic Auto Men's Watch H32515535'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Men's Watch EFV-610D'\n  - Name='Fossil The Commuter Auto Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Swiss Precision Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Sport Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Hamilton Khaki Aviation Air Race Auto'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Skeleton Automatic Water Resist Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice EFS-S640ZE-1AER'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu 3'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

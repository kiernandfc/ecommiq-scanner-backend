    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's TW000R434 Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Titanium/Fabric'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Deepwater Reef 200'\n  - Name='Timex Men's TW2U38400ZV Automatic 40mm Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex x Peanuts Marlin 38mm Snoopy 75th Anniversary Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's M79'\n  - Name='Timex x Peanuts Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Harborside Coast Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Sub-Dial Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex x Peanuts Marlin Automatic Saxophonist Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Automatic Green Dial Watch TW2V24700'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Hand Wind Blue Dial Watch TW2V00700'\n  - Name='Timex Mens Watches TW2V72200 Harborside Coast Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's MK1 Automatic Watch with Fabric Strap'\n  - Name='Men's M79 Automatic Black Watch Timex'\n  - Name='Men Timex Marlin Jet Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's M79 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Waterbury Metropolitan Automatic watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Snoopy Easy Rider Watch TW2V63100'\n  - Name='Timex Huckberry Titanium Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='The James Brand Timex Automatic GMT Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

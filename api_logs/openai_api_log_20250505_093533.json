Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Bracelet Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Ladies Military Mechanical Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Gemini Quartz Diamond Black Dial Watch 98D177'\n  - Name='Tissot Tissot PRC 100 Silver Men's Watch T22.2.581.31 T22258131'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Breaker Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Nate Leather Chronograph Watch JR1390'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Quickster Nato'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Box Set Quartz Crystal Black Dial Watch and Necklace Set 98K116'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Military Type Running Swiss Cal.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='TW2R23300 Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Titanium QA 38mm Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Military Automatic Seiko SNZG07 100M Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Aw-40 Field Trainer Mod 385 Japan Wr100 Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch W-218H'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Black Watch MRW-230H-1E2VEF'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Standard Analog Dial Quartz MTP-E735 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton | Khaki Field Auto | Stainless steel | 38mm'\n  - Name='Casio Vintage Watch A130WE'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Classic Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio G-Shock Watch GBD-200'\n  - Name='Casio Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Midsize Multifunction'\n  - Name='CASIO Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock G-Steel Men's GST-B100-1AER Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Heavy Duty'\n  - Name='Casio Protrek Multi Field Line Men's Dura Soft Band'\n  - Name='G-Shock Men's Watch Casio'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1302P'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H69301131 Steel Black 33mm'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's X Pan Am Chronograph 42mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Classics Mechanical Automatic Wind Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Q Timex M79 Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Mechanical Self-winding Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Mechanical Stainless Steel Diving Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Peanuts Sketch Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Round Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Mechanical Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Trend Automatic Round Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Day Date'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Waterbury Classic Automatic Men's Watch with Leather Band'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Day Date Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='TIMEX Luxury Automatic Watch Automatic Mechanical Watch Male American Stainl'\n  - Name='Citizen Elegance Mens Automatic NH9131-73A'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-B310'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Chronograph'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Tsuyosa Automatic Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men Watch Enticer Men MTP1374L 7AVDF A835 Brown Leather'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Enticer Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio General'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch SRPE80'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

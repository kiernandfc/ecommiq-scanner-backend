It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Skagen Signatur Watch SKW6434'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Ancher Mesh Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Essentials Core Sur553 Classic Analog Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='AW1236-03A Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Chronograph'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Corso Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Chronograph Quartz Black Dial Men's Watch SSB429P1'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Classic Quartz Titanium Watch with Sapphire Crystal'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Watch Essentials Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 96A000 Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Chronograph FS4735 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Holst Chronograph Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Casio Women's'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Prestige Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Limited Edition'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Modern Day Date Indicator Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Men's Automatic Blue Dial Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

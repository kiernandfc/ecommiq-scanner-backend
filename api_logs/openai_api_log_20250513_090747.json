    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marc Anthony Series X Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-6161'\n  - Name='SRPK17 Seiko 5 Sports 55th Anniversary Limited Edition'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Super Cub Blue Dial Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Titanium Auto'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Contemporary Automatic RA-AR0102S10B Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Steel Mesh Band Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Seiko Presage Automatic Zen Garden Sapphire SSA397J1'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-6316'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Watch SRPD87'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko Presage SSA441J Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex 2007 Diver Automatic SPB103'\n  - Name='Bulova Mens 96A320 Watch Aerojet Automatic 38mm 3ATM'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-5937'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Watchmaking 110TH Anniversary Limited Edition SPB395'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Flight II Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Pilot Pioneer Chronograph Automatic Watch h76456955'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Automatic GMT LE'\n  - Name='Men's Brown Skagen Multifunction Leather Strap Watch SKW6066'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's PR 100 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Damian Lillard Special Edition Auto Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

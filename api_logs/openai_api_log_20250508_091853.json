Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Deepwater Meridian Rubber Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Q 40mm Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Orient Contemporary Watch RA-AA0C04B39B'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Three-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio CA53WF Databank Digital Calculator Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Star Sports Diver Automatic RE-AU0302L00B Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-One Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Ray Raven II Automatic Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm H70605163'\n  - Name='Citizen Citizen Eco-Drive Brown Dial Men's Watch BM8595-16H'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive World Time A-T Watch AT9071-58E'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-1612'\n  - Name='ORIENT SPORTS Automatic RN-AA0006B'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Wrist Watch AZ-1614'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Open Heart Automatic fag03001b0 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Watch Essentials Chronograph'\n  - Name='Seiko5 Sports Field Series Mechanical Automatic Analog'\n  - Name='Watch Chronograph Fossil Men's Sport Tourer'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Dial Watch AW1760'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Sports Style Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports “Sports Style”'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AA0C Japanese Automatic Hand-Winding Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Automatic RA-AC0Q12L 75th Anniversary Limited Edition'\n  - Name='Casio Pro Trek Angler Line Solar Atomic Analog Digital Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

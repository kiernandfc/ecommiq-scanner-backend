    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's x Peanuts Marlin 40mm'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Peanuts Sketch Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Watch TX TW2T69700'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic California Dial Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Automatic Silver Dial'\n  - Name='Timex City Watch TW2V05100'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Hand-Wound x Peanuts Reissue Watch'\n  - Name='Women Timex Marlin Hand-Wound California TW2U96700'\n  - Name='Men's Timex M79 Automatic 40mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Mk1 Mechanical Fabric Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex Alpinist SPB117'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Automatic Watch NY0141-10L NY0141-10LE'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watches'\n  - Name='Citizen Zenshin Super Titanium Men's Watch Automatic NJ0180-80'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic White Dial Stainless Steel Watch SNK789'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Day Date Watch EF326D-5A'\n  - Name='Citizen Grand Touring Signature Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Standard Analog Stainless Steel Dial Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock MR-G Frogman Men's MRGBF1000B-1A'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SArg011 Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Metal Worldtimer Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

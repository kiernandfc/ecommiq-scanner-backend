    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader 35mm Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Waterbury Chronograph TW2V42500VQ'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Timex Q Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Q Chronograph 40mm'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Q Timex Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Trend Legacy Tonneau Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Heritage Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Q Chronograph Bracelet Watch 40mm'\n  - Name='Timex Waterbury Heritage Chronograph Watch TW2Y19300-OS'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Waterbury Traditional Chronograph 41mm Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Chronograph Tachymeter Watch'\n  - Name='TW2W60300 Timex Men's Marlin Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Traditional Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Traditional Fly Back Chronograph'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch with Croco Pattern'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Metropolitan Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Easy Reader Day Date 35mm Leather Strap | Brown/Silver-Tone/White, Brass/LLB'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Retro Mechanical Watch (1980s)'\n  - Name='Citizen Mechanical Multi Hands Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Analog Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Rolan Eco-Drive Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0C05L19B'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

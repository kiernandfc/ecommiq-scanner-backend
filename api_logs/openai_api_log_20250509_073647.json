Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Expedition Grid Shock 50mm Resin Strap'\n  - Name='TW2W60300 Timex Men's Marlin Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Sea Automatic Dial Men's Watch NY0040'\n  - Name='Seiko quartz Black Dial Men's Watch SUR535P1'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports “Sports Style” Field Collection'\n  - Name='Seiko Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Promaster Sea Eco Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin tactix 7 Tactical GPS Watch Bundle Ruggedly Built'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Leather Watch 21 Jewels'\n  - Name='Orient Sport Solar Ivory Dial Mens Watch RA-WJ0003S10B'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 8 Sapphire Solar GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Luther Three-hand'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Black Knights Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Perpetual Black Dial Men's Watch BX1001-89L'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Adventurer'\n  - Name='Garmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPG39 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Fenmore Multifunction Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Minimalist Three-Hand Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Fossil Retro Traveler Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 7S'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

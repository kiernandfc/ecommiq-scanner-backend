    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Taylor Stitch\"\nReference Product Name: \"The Jack Shirt\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Oxford button-down is a stylish wardrobe staple with endless versatility, so it’s no surprise that our signature Oxford, The Jack, has become a mainstay of our roster. Its burly 100% organic cotton basket weave and double-needle felled construction make it sturdy enough to stand up to the roughest workday, while peerless tailoring and a clean, pleatless design means it’s snazzy enough for your next night on the town. Soft to the touch but built for a decade of solid wear. Oxford is a perfectly versatile fabric that looks just as good pressed as it does pulled off the back of a chair. While traditional cotton uses 25% of the world's pesticides, our organic cotton doesn't use a drop. A better shirt, Responsibly Built For The Long Haul. 6-oz. 100% organic cotton. Made from our burly rugby oxford. Our signature Jack button-down collar. Garment dyed and washed for a soft, lived-in feel. Double-needle felled construction throughout. Natural buttons.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph FS4656 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPK18 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EFR552SBK-1A Japanese Automatic Stainless-steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Chronograph SS Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AK0403N Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Enticer MTP-E305RG-7AVDF'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 55 GPS Running Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02839-52 35.4mm 2024'\n  - Name='Garmin GPS Running Smartwatch Forerunner'\n  - Name='Casio Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EFR-S565L-1AV Chronograph Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Mens Contemporary RA-AR0009L30B Automatic'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Driver'\n  - Name='Casio J Brackett Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Carlie Automatic Rose Gold-Tone Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Men's EFR-526D'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin vivomove Trend Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Garmin 010-02562-41 42mm 2021'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 55 GPS Running Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 165 Music'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Captain Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

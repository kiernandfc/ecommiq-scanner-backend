Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Expedition Metal Field 39mm Leather Strap T40051'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Rugged Core Analog Field Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Field Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Titanium QA 38mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Tide-Temp-Compass 43mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Metal Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Tide-Temp-Compass Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Tide Temp Compass 45mm Watch TW2V22100'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki X Wind Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Women's Expedition Field Mini Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Women's Expedition Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Acadia National Park Watch with Fabric Strap'\n  - Name='TW4B28000 Timex Expedition CAT Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Traprock Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Traditional Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Anchorage 43mm Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Gallatin Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition T47012'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Watch Expedition Scout 40mm Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Acadia Rugged Black TW4B26300'\n  - Name='Timex Yellowstone National Park Resin Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Sierra Analogue Waterproof Watch with Buckle Clasp'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

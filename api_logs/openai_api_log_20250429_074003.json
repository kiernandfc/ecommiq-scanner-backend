Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hack Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Quartz NATO Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Hagen Three-Hand Brown Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Contemporary RA-AA0C04B19B Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Brycen Dial Nylon Strap Band Men's watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Geo Trekker Eco Men's Watch BY3006-53H'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Watch AW5000-24E'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Dial Men's Watch AW0100-86'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Black Dial Men's Watch BM8590-10E'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Watch Men's'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Water Resistant Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sullivan Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Three-Hand'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bannon Three-Hand Date Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's 96A245 A-15 Pilot Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Le Locle Powermatic 80 20th Anniversary'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock DW-D5600P-8JF Speed Military Watch'\n  - Name='Women's Casio Silver Watch ltp-1215a-7b2'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Quartz Kuppel Dial Watch SKW'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

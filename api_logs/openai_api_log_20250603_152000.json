    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Timex Q Falcon Eye Watch'\n  - Name='TIMEX Luxury Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='men Timex Deepwater Reef Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Automatic Swiss Made Watch with Calf Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Power Reserve Auto 42mm Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Tsuki-yomi A-T Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Black Watch MRW-230H-1E2VEF'\n  - Name='Casio Men's MTD-1045 Formal Gold Dial Date Two Tone Quartz Analog Watch'\n  - Name='G-Shock MR-G'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Green Dial Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='ORIENT Men's Automatic Flight Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='SKW6273 Mens Skagen Hagen Watch'\n  - Name='Casio A168WEPC-7A Pac MAN-Watch A168WEPC-7AER'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Ga-110nc Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Skeleton Auto Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Auto 41mm Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Intra-Matic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Watch Promaster CA4660-61A Navihawk'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Watch Promaster NB6046-59E Air Automatic Men's GMT'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Lille Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G Shock Women's watch GMAP2100'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

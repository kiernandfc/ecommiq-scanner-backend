Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Timex Standard 40mm Fabric Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch TW2V26600'\n  - Name='Timex Men's IRONMAN Classic 30 Full-Size Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Minnesota Wild Gamer Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Moon Phase Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Ironman Classic 30 Digital Watch with Resin Strap'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Aqpk401 Military Field Watch Quartz White Full-lume Dial'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Defender Solar-Powered Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Breaker Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Urban Military Automatic Hand-wound Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Oregon Ducks Classic Sport Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Vintage 50susa Military Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5X Sapphire'\n  - Name='Orient Orient Contemporary Chronograph White Dial Men's Watch RATX0306S10B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Automatic Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Limited Edition'\n  - Name='SSB321'\n  - Name='RELIC by Fossil Men's Rylan Stainless Steel Diamond Accent Watch Set'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Washington Huskies Classic Sport Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sport Tourer Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR516 Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Quartz Chronograph Calendar Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

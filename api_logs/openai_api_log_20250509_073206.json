    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Presage Craftsmanship Series Arita Porcelain SPB293'\n  - Name='Fossil Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Townsman Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Men's Titanium Watch NJ0180-80'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports SRPD71 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Modern Machine ME3080 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton H327150 Automatic Mechanical Date Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Battery Operated Gold Metal Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Pr 100 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Watch SKW3121 SIGNATUR'\n  - Name='Skagen Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch MTP-M305'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Japan Made Black with Gold Bezel 55 Fathoms Men's Watch SNZH57J1'\n  - Name='Fossil Automatic Mechanical Winding Analog Dress'\n  - Name='Men's Casio General'\n  - Name='Hamilton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock GXW-56-1AER'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic BVA Series 115 Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Tillie Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Tissot Heritage Small Second 1938 COSC'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 965'\n  - Name='Skagen Quartz'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Lille Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

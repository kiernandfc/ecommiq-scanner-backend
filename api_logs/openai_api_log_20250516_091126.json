Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex 1968 Diver's Modern Re-Interpretation GMT SPB381'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Jet Team Limited Edition Prospex Radio- Sync Solar Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Coutura Solar Chronograph'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Stainless Steel Diver's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Standard Analog Dial Quartz 100M Men's Watch MTD125D'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch GD350'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hack Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Oceanographer GMT Watch 98B407'\n  - Name='Bulova Surveyor Men's Watch 96A292'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H69439531 2025'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field H69419363'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marines Sport Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='B&P, FL Hamilton Khaki Field Day Date Automatic Winding H705350'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Aviation X-Wind Chrono Auto'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Day Date Automatic Watch H70695735'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Expedition Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Hamilton Khaki Aviation Pilot Auto Day Date Watch H64785835'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Officer Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field H70225130 2025'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Men's Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

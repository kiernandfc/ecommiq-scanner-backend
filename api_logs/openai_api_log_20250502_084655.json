    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Denmark Gent's Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Skagen 583XLSLB 38mm Men`s Multi-Function Brown Leather Watch - Skagen Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Skagen Anita Lille Traditional Watch'\n  - Name='Casioak Mod Royal Oak Casio G-Shock GA-2100 Gold Metal Watch'\n  - Name='SEIKO 5 Extremely Rare Automatic Day-Date'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Analog Digital Combination AMW-870'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice ECB-900DB-1AER Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Stainless Steel Watch 96A239'\n  - Name='Prx Powermatic 80 Watch Tissot Men's'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Nillson Three-Hand Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Women Skagen Analogue 'Anita' Watch SKW2150'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Multi-Function Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Freja Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Jazzmaster Skeleton Auto'\n  - Name='Casio Men's World Time Digital Unisex Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch SRPD71K2'\n  - Name='Casio Casiotron 50th Anniversary Limited Watch TRN50-2A'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Stainless Steel Band Watch MTP-VT04'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock MT-G Radio Men's Solar mtgs1000bd-1a'\n  - Name='Casioak Mod Royal Oak Casio G-Shock GA-2100 Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Oceanus OCW-T150-1AJF Tough MVT'\n  - Name='Skagen watch SKW6446'\n  - Name='Orient Starfish Day and Date Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Women's 358XSSLBC Skagen Freja Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Analogue 'Freja' Watch SKW3017'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

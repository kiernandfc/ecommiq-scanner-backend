    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Expedition Scout\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Expedition Titanium is ready to go the distance, living up to the Timex legacy of fully equipping you for your adventures ahead while embodying the kind of tradition you can wear every day. Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Chronograph Watch T49905'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition North Field Chronograph'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout 43 Analog Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition CAT5 Digital Watch with Resin Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Cat'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition North Tide Temp Compass 45mm Watch TW2V22100'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Acadia Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Tillie Mini Three-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Camo Nighthawk Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Garrison Avion Super Titanium Weekender Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Automatic Multifunction Gift'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Heritage Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Standard Analog Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil MEN Grant Chronograph Light Brown Leather Watch - Brown - One size'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock GA-V01 Series gav01'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bannon Multifunction'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Date 24hr Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin fenix 7X Pro Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='Skagen s Grenen Solar Powered Leather Strap Watch 37mm'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Black Label 2-Hand Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Skagen Balder Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Raquel Two-Hand Stainless Steel Ring Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Carlie Three-Hand'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

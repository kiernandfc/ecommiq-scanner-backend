Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Ansel Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Army Black Knights Machine Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Mechanical Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova Maquina Military Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Neo Classic Sports Automatic Hand-Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force RN-AC0N03E Automatic Mechanical Watch Made in Japan'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's Sutton Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Type A17a Vintage Military Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch RA-AA0C01B19B'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force AC0L Automatic Orange Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0L08Y00B'\n  - Name='Orient Tri Star Automatic Stainless Steel Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Stainless Steel Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Melbye Multifunction Titanium Watch SKW6078'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 745 GPS Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Bronson Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Quartz Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Grenen Solar Powered Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Aaren Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Officer H694190 Steel Green 38mm'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Intra-Matic Auto Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Waterproof Digital Sport Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR 100 Sport Chronograph Watch T1016171105100'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice EFS-S640'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1370L-1AVDF'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Murph 38mm H70405130'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic (1984)'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Japanese Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Open Heart Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch Edifice ERA-500DB ERA500L-1A'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch W-218H'\n  - Name='Casio Mens Edifice ECB-S10D'\n  - Name='Women's Skagen Signature White Leather Band Watch SKW2595'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Black Dial Men's Stainless Steel Watch SNK361'\n  - Name='SRPJ45 Seiko Men's 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signatur Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Mellem Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Grenen Lille Espresso Leather Watchband Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Lille Analogue Watch'\n  - Name='Grenen By Skagen Women M-22ssss Gray Dial Milanese/mesh 26mm Quartz'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

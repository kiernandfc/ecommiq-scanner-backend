It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen BM7624-82A'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster BN0158-18X Herren Eco-Drive'\n  - Name='Citizen Citizen Bi5050-54e Stahl'\n  - Name='Citizen Herren Eco Drive BM7108'\n  - Name='Citizen Herrenuhr Eco Drive AW1640-83E'\n  - Name='Seiko SNK623K1'\n  - Name='Citizen Herren AW1231'\n  - Name='Citizen Herren BM7108-22L'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Enticer Stainless Steel Black Dial MTP-VD01D-1BVUDF'\n  - Name='Casio ur'\n  - Name='Fossil Herren Machine'\n  - Name='Fossil Machine FS4552 Herren'\n  - Name='Fossil Herren Chronograph Nate JR1437'\n  - Name='Fossil Townsman Herren'\n  - Name='Fossil Chronograph Herren FB-01 FS5915'\n  - Name='Fossil Machine FS5901 Herren'\n  - Name='Fossil Chronograph Neutra FS5453 Herren'\n  - Name='Fossil Herren Chronograph Bronson FS5712'\n  - Name='Fossil Bronson FS5714 Herren'\n  - Name='Fossil Herren Machine FS4682'\n  - Name='Fossil Herren Uhr FS6089 schwarz'\n  - Name='FOSSIL Mod.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout 36 Watch with Natural Nylon Strap'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic 40mm Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Eco-Drive Promaster Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Gilmore Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen USAF Men's Eco-Drive Classic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Blue Dive Two-Tone Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Evanston Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Lux Luther Three-Hand'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Corso Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Carraway Three-Hand Gold-Tone Stainless Steel Watch FS6009'\n  - Name='Fossil Watch Men's Carter Express Pr-5425 Battery'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Quartz Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm H70605163'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Hagen Multi-Function Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Denmark Sport Field Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Titanium Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Mud Resistant Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Forester Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Solar Watch AQS'\n  - Name='Casio Vintage Collection A1000D7EF D193 Silver Digital Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

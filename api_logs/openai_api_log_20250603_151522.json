Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Field Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Slip-Thru Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Metal Field Quartz Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Field Watch TW4B16000JV'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition North Field Post Solar Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Mens Expedition Scout 40mm Leather Strap Watch TWC001200'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Fabric Band Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Solar Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Expedition Scout Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic SNXS SRPK87K1'\n  - Name='G-Shock Watch Casio'\n  - Name='Tissot Couturier Chronograph'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PRX Powermatic 80 Automatic Watch with 18K Gold Bezel'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Desir Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Tissot T1434103302100 Everytime Gent Watches'\n  - Name='Tissot T-Touch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Automatic III White Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Mathey Tissot Men's Lancelot Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Tissot Prx Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Carson Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chemin des Tourelles Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Prx Powermatic 80 Automatic'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

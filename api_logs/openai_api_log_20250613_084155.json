Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Aaren Kulor SKW6512|Discount Watch Store'\n  - Name='Skagen Kristoffer SKW6525 Quartz Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Khaki Field Expedition Auto'\n  - Name='Skagen Denmark Men's Ancher Black Ion Plated Watch - SKW6454'\n  - Name='Mens Skagen SKW6064 Silver Stainless Steel Mesh Band Water Resistant 3 ATM Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Mako Solar Sky Blue Limited Edition RA-TX0210L'\n  - Name='Orient SAC04001W0'\n  - Name='orient-watches Orient Sport Mako Iii GREEN RA-AA0004E19B RA-AA0004E-OS'\n  - Name='Skagen SKW2354 Ladies Hagen Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar 1000 Powermatic 80'\n  - Name='Tissot V8 Chrono Quarz'\n  - Name='CASIO PRO TREK Horloge PRG-330-1 | Zwart'\n  - Name='Relógio Fossil Cronógrafo Pele CH2565 Men'\n  - Name='Jam Bulova Casual Men's Watches BLV 98A190'\n  - Name='Jam Tangan Otomatis Stainless Steel Pria Bulova Classic'\n  - Name='Skagen Hagen Leather Strap White Dial Quartz SKW6929 Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Female Stainless Steel Wrist watch Gold Size ONESIZE'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Open Heart Kol Saati'\n  - Name='Khaki Field Day Date Auto'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 2'\n  - Name='Hamilton h38446732 american classic intra-matic autochrono komple siyah kol saati'\n  - Name='Orient Watches Classic Sun & Moon 43 Mm 手表 RA-AK0010B-OS'\n  - Name='Orient Watches Ra-ap0004s10b 鐘 棕色'\n  - Name='ORIENT x PEANUTS 75th Anniversary Mako 40 Diver 限量版 RA-AC0Q08S'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Refurbished Smartwatch HR - Falster 3 Gunmetal Gauge Mesh'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

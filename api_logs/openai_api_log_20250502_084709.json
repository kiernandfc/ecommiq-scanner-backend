    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Casio Standard Analog Stainless Steel Dial Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Regard Jewelry Casio G-Shock Royal Oak Conversion Full'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock GA-2300'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SNKL79 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Enticer Multifunction Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Bluetooth Watch EQB800'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Men's RA-AC0P02L10B Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Anita Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice ECB-10DB-1A9EF Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Watch Dial Men's NH8390-20LE'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Tsuki-yomi A-T Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Heat Gradation Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Essentials Automatic Green Dial Watch SRPH89'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Steel Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's'\n  - Name='Bulova 96A266 Sutton Automatic 43mm 3atm'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Melbye Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Japanese Automatic Hand-Winding Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sun Moon Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Titanium Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen SKW6702 Gents Watch - Horizont'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster h32635622 Power Reserve Automatic Men's watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

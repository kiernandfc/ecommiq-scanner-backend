Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Field Gear Military Showa'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SUR487 Essentials Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Special Edition Men's Black Checkered Automatic Watch SRPK67'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Military Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Hamilton Khaki Officer H70655733'\n  - Name='Hamilton KHAKI FIELD DAY DATE'\n  - Name='Garmin fēnix 7 Sapphire Solar'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3 50mm Solar Charged Display Rugged Outdoor GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Quartz Black Dial BI5010-59E Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Quartz Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sport Field Street Style Automatic Cushion'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex S802-00a0 Field Master Degital Solar Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPK18 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Machine Chronograph Black Eco Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Powermatic 80 Unisex Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Lightweight Titanium Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar 1000 Quartz Diamond Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

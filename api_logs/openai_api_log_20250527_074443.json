    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='CASIO G-SHOCK Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's M E 3021 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Evanston Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Me3003 Seconds Hand Round Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Jazzmaster Skeleton Lady Auto Watch H32265101'\n  - Name='Garmin Instinct 3'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MWD-110H'\n  - Name='CASIO BABY-G BGD-565US-7JF'\n  - Name='Casio G-shock Gw-1500j-1ajf Digital Analog Solar Black Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Croco Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Women's Emma Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Snke01 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Townsman Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Spirit of Liberty Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Viewmatic Auto H42725551'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Scuba Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Mens Casio G Shock 6900 White Diamond Watch 3.0 Ct'\n  - Name='Casio Oceanus Analog Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO G-shock GA-2100NNJ-8A'\n  - Name='Fossil Watch Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Sutton Mechanical Pocket Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Navy Frogman Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's New Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Automatic Watch NJ0170-83'\n  - Name='CITIZEN OPEN HEART AUTOMATIC NH9130-84A'\n  - Name='Citizen SERIES8 GMT GMT Automatic Gold Dial Men's Watch NB6032-53P, Automatic Movement, Stainless Steel Strap, 41 mm Case in Two Tone / Gold / Gold'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Essentials Blue Dial Automatic Watch SRPH87'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen NB6004 Promaster Titanium Automatic'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic NJ0130-88A Watch | StarBuy'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic SNK809K Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Special Edition Men's SRPK65'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Marine Automatic Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Vintage Blackie Automatic Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Tsuyosa Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Mod Daydate Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Diver's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Mod Datejust Classic'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Series 8 Mechanical Abarth Collaboration Limited Edition Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Watch SNKE49K1'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Diver Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Automatic Mechanical Men`s Black Dial Watch NH9110-81E - Citizen Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Men Citizen Automatic Stainless Steel Blue Dial Watch NJ0100-89L'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Series 8 Automatic NB6031-56E Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Sapphire Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

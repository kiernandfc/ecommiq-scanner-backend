    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar 1000 Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Couturier Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's American Classic Spirit of Liberty Auto Watch H42445551'\n  - Name='Garmin Quatix 5 Sapphire Marine GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic 21 Jewels SNXG47K1 SNXG47K Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch MTP-1384D'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Millenia Automatic Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's H70595963 Khaki Field Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Seiko 5 Automatic Watch SNKE49K1'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog-Digital Sport Watch Dial AEQ-120W'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Carson Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton American Classic Intra-Matic Auto Chrono Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Venu GPS Smartwatch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Automatic Swiss Made Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Mens Rose Gold Finish Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's T1222073603300 Carson Premium Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Seastar 1000 Quartz'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Tradition Automatic Small Second'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's h76565725 Khaki Aviation Automatic'\n  - Name='Garmin Fenix 5S'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

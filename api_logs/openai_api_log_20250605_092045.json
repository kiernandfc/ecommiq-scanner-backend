Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",
    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Ventura Open Heart Auto'\n  - Name='Bulova Classic 98A179 Automatic Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Classic Small Second Automatic Mechanical Winding'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD75 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice Chronograph EFR-539D-1A2VUEF Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Supersport Chrono Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Sports Watch MTP-VD03'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's Pr 100 Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Automatic Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch AQS820W'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm'\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-Shock'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Navy Frogman Men's Automatic'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Ancher Three-Hand Date Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Automatic III White Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Ancher Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

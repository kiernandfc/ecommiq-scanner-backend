    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Field Solar Eco-Friendly Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Chicago Chronograph Watch with Low Lead Bracelet'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Classic Stainless Steel Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Men's TW2V85200 Timex UFC Command Fight Week Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch with Indiglo Expander'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Metal Field Watch TW4B16000JV'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Titanium Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko MECHANICAL Dress Line SZSB012 Automatic Winding Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Selection Mechanical Self-Winding Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Classic Line Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sun & Moon Version 2 Automatic Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Wilton Men's GMT 96B385'\n  - Name='Orient Star RE-AV0B11E Layered Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watches Black'\n  - Name='Orient Sports RN-AA0916L Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Orient Star Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='G-Shock GSTB400D-1A G-Steel Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Star Automatic Skeleton Dial Mens Watch RE-BZ0001S00B'\n  - Name='Skagen Grenen Charcoal Dial Ladies Watch SKW6836'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Anita Lille Three-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Ray Raven II Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch FAA02003B9, Automatic Movement, Stainless Steel Strap, 41.5mm Case'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Navy Pioneer Small Second H78415733 Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Leather Strap Mechanical Hand-Wound Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Q Timex GMT'\n  - Name='Men's Watch Timex Ironman Challenger Chronograph 44mm Silicone Strap'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Avion Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Forester Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Ancher Dial Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Geo Trekker Eco Men's Watch BY3006-53H'\n  - Name='Citizen Q&q Falcon Black Day Field Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Large Classic Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Men's Alpinist Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Fieldmaster Solar Lowercase Mens Watch SBDJ029'\n  - Name='Skagen Dual Time Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic 21 Dial Day/Date'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Nillson Three-Hand Quartz Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chrono XL Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Seiko 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex 1968 Diver's Modern Re-Interpretation GMT Men's SPB381'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Stainless Steel Watch 96A239'\n  - Name='Skagen Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen watch SKW6446'\n  - Name='SKAGEN DENMARK - WATCHES'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Promaster Nighthawk Watch with Sikorsky'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

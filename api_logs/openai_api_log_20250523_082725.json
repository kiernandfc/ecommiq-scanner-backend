Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Everett Chronograph Watch FS6105'\n  - Name='Orient Women's Contemporary Quartz Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPG39 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG41 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SSK017 Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic GMT'\n  - Name='Casio Analog Digital Combination Dial Quartz Watch AMW870A-2AV Men's'\n  - Name='Citizen Eco-Drive Men's Promaster Dive Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Automatic Field Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Overland Field Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Chronograph Black Leather Strap FS4812 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Defender Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AK0403N10B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Army Star Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0L06B00B, Automatic Movement, Stainless Steel Strap, 45 mm Case in Black / Yellow'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Rhett Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch and Strap Set'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Multi- Hands Multi- Needle Field'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's H694590 Manual Winding'\n  - Name='Orient Multi-Year Calendar Automatic Sports Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chronograph Supersport Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Military Green Dial Strap'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force Automatic Red Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0L02R, Automatic Movement, Stainless Steel Strap, 45 mm Case in Red / Black'\n  - Name='Orient Fieldwatch Automatic Wristwatchorient Rnt060201'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

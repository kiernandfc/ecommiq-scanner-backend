    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Signatur Mechanical Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Jazzmaster Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Golfer'\n  - Name='Garmin MARQ Athlete'\n  - Name='SKW6889 Skagen Men's Kuppel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Edifice EF-539D-1AVEF'\n  - Name='Citizen Series 8 Automatic Men's Watch NA1010-84X'\n  - Name='Men CITIZEN NH9114-99P CITIZEN Collection Mechanical'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Diver's Watch'\n  - Name='Automatic Silver Dial Ladies Watch PR1040-88A by Citizen'\n  - Name='Casio EFB-710D EFB-710D-2AVUEF'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Enticer Classic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Watch Promaster NB6046-59E Air Automatic Men's GMT'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's NH7505-84E Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Mechanical Automatic Open Heart Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen NB4020 Citizen Collection Mechanical Classical Line'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic 100m Rose Gold Watch'\n  - Name='CITIZEN Watches Mechanical Automatic NB1050-59L Stainless Steel Silver mechanical Navy dial mens Used Authentic'\n  - Name='Citizen Kuroshio '64 Automatic Asia Limited Edition Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Fujitsubo Limited Edition NB6026-56L Men's'\n  - Name='Men's Citizen Mechanical Automatic Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Citizen Citizen Collection Mechanical Open Heart Automatic Winding (With Manual Winding) Men's Type NP1010-78E'\n  - Name='Citizen Sport Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

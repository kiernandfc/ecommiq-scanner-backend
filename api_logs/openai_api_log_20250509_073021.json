    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='TW2V67900 Timex Men's Legacy Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Brown Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Scout Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Women's TW2T18300 Marlin Watch'\n  - Name='Timex 1970s Automatic Cat Eye Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Stainless Steel Automatic Speidel Watch Band'\n  - Name='Timex Men's x Peanuts M79 40mm'\n  - Name='Men's TW2V67800 Timex Legacy Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition Titanium Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Deepwater Meridian 200 Stainless Steel with Sapphire Crystal'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Traditional GMT Calf Leather'\n  - Name='Timex Day Date Automatic Mechanical Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Harborside Coast Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Automatic Date Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Peanuts Sketch Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Marlin Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Analog Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex M 108 Sweep SEC Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Mercury Easy Reader Mechanical Automatic'\n  - Name='Timex Vintage Beautiful Automatic Calendar Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Automatic Swiss Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPJ89 Automatic Green Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Vintage Hamilton Automatic'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Day/Date Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Oceanographer GMT Watch 98B407'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex x seconde/seconde/ Q 38mm Loser'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Deepwater Reef 200 Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Navi XL Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen series8 NB6011-11W Mechanical? 10 ATMwatch 2022.12 released'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPK69'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPE53 Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Grant Sport Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='MARVEL Fossil Limited Edition DEADPOOL Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Automatic Skeleton Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Wilton Automatic Watch 43mm 96A217'\n  - Name='Bulova Mens 96A317 Watch Aerojet Automatic 38mm 3ATM'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Version 7 Automatic Stainless Steel Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Edifice EFR-526LJ-1AJF Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Casio - Casio Watch Edifice eqw-a1200db-1aer'\n  - Name='Casio Gold Jubilee Vintage Dress Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT PRX Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Hagen Slim Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Series8 870 Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch NA1037-53L'\n  - Name='Fossil X The Batman Automatic Limited Le114s'\n  - Name='Fossil Vintage Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Casio MTP-1302PD-1A2VEF Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Twist Arkitekt Me-1017 Watch Men Open Heart Black Dial 50m'\n  - Name='TISSOT Chemin Des Tourelles Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Automatic Dial Men's Watch NY0100-50'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

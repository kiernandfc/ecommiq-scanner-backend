    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Ventura XXL Automatic H24655331 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Automatic Chronograph'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AA0812L19B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Watch 98B422'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch Edifice EFB-730D'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Art Deco Pocket Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton H323950 Automatic Wr 5bar Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Seastar Automatic Rubber'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage Men's Prestige Line Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Edifice Tom's 50th Anniversary Edition Men's EFSS641TMS1A Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's Automatic 17 Jewel Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Automatic Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Chemin Des Tourelles Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Men's COUTURIER CHRONOGRAPH WATCH'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage SARY142 Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Automatic Gold Plated'\n  - Name='Bulova Sutton Automatic Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Limited Edition Series X Marc Anthony Automatic Men's Watch 97A195'\n  - Name='Bulova Automatic Date Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Automatic Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice ECB'\n  - Name='Bulova Women's Marine Star Watch 96L324'\n  - Name='Ladies Fossil ME3229 Watches ME3247'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Couturier Powermatic 80 Automatic Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

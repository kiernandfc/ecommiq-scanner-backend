Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD55 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='G Watch Casio Baby Women's'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SSK003 Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Touch Connect Sport Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Approach S12 GPS Golf Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Melbye Titanium Case with Mesh Men's Band SKW6007 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Black Titanium Multifunction Watch Adult'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR 100 Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Surveyor Automatic Watch 98B422'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Jorn Stainless Steel Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Mellem Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Rectangular Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Riis Minimalist Three-Hand Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition CAT5 Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Casio Pac-Man F91WPC-1A Vintage Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dean Stainless Steel Watch FS4721IE'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock Watch'\n  - Name='Casio G-Shock Men's GM110BD-1A9 Stainless Steel Analog-Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Women's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Mens Edifice EFR-575'\n  - Name='MRGBF1000R1A | G-SHOCK MR-G Black | CASIO'\n  - Name='1996 CASIO MILITARY G-SHOCK DW-003 Wristwach G-LIDE illuminator'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch WS-B1000'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Everett Chronograph Watch FS6105'\n  - Name='Orient Women's Contemporary Quartz Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Automatic Blue Dial Watch RA-AC0M10L RA-AC0M10L30B'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch with Croco Pattern'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports SRPD93'\n  - Name='Timex x Peanuts Marlin Automatic Saxophonist Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Stainless Steel Watch SNKP17J1'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Orient M-Force Automatic Black Dial Men's Watch RA-AC0L01B00B'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AR0004S30B'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Hack Automatic Leather Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Sport Tourer Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Auto Watch'\n  - Name='Orient 2nd Generation Bambino Automatic White Dial Men's Watch FAC00005W0'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Flynn Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin Forerunner 570'\n  - Name='Men's Timex Analogue 'Legacy' Watch TW2Y04300'\n  - Name='Men's TW2V67600 Timex Waterbury Standard Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Sports Solar Powered Chronograph Men's Watch RA-TX0206L10B'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Skyhawk A-T Men's JY8146-54E Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Classic Sun & Moon Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Chronograph Watch W737HX-5AV'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Analog Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Bambino Classic Automatic FAC00001B0 Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

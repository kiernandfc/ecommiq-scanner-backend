    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Marlin Automatic California Dial Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Casio MTD330D-1AV Enticer Chronograph Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Marine Star Automatic Watch 98A228'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Ballade Automatic Chronometer Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Cocktail Time SRPK48'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Auto 42mm'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Promaster Dive E365 Watch'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Auto 41mm Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Watch G-Shock'\n  - Name='Fossil Vintage Muse Automatic Skeleton Dial Watch'\n  - Name='G-Shock X J Balvin DWE5600JB1A9'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Surveyor Bulova Men's 96A275 Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Bambino Sun & Moon Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 98A255'\n  - Name='Men's Casio MTP watch MTP-1375PD'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Skeleton Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Bulova Marine Star Automatic 98A273 Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Carson Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot T- My Lady Automatic 18K Gold Bezel'\n  - Name='Tissot PRS 516 Powermatic 80 Automatic Dial Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Chronograph Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Gold-Tone Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Male Analog Stainless Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

    "user_prompt": "\nReference Brand: \"Timex\"\nReference Product Name: \"Marlin Automatic\"\nReference Product Description:\nThe Marlin Automatic Sub-Dial brings a modern-retro update to our 1960s Marlin. Now with a stainless-steel bracelet, its sleek design has a contemporary style that’s sharp enough for any outing. While its full Arabic dial and date feature stay true to our much-loved Marlin automatics, this timepiece brings sophisticated details like a 24-hour format sub-dial at the 9 o’clock position and a recycled stainless-steel case in a curved cushion shape. The Miyota Japanese automatic movement is showcased through an exhibition caseback which bears the Marlin name and a detailed etching of the iconic marlin fish. The full Marlin name also graces the dial and crown to honor not only our watchmaking legacy, but the ever-evolving style of this suave ‘60s icon.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Citizen Forma 4 Automatic Day-date Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Series 5 Automatic White Grid Dial Watch SNXF05'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Prospex Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic White Dial Men's Watch SNKD97J1'\n  - Name='Seiko Presage Automatic Style 60s SSK011J1'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SSA Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SNKE06K1 Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Mechanical Metal Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Series8 890 Automatic Men's Watch NB6060-58L'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Contemporary Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Garmin vivosmart 5'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Casio Edifice EFB-109D'\n  - Name='Casio Men's G-Shock G-STEEL'\n  - Name='Men's CASIO G-Shock Watch GAV01'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Automatic Mechanical Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Promaster Marine Automatic Titanium Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Sun Moon Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Hamilton Khaki Field Auto H70595133'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Automatic Mechanical Watch'\n  - Name='TISSOT Gentleman Powermatic 80 Silicium Men's 18K'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Hagen Micro Two-Hand Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Signatur Sport Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

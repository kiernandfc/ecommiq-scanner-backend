Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='SRPJ45 Seiko Men's 5 Sports'\n  - Name='Orient Mens Watch TAC00009'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's T-Sport Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Chronograph Quartz Watch with Black Silicone Strap'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Townsman Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPD51 Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Metropolitan Automatic Leather Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Mens Bannon Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's PCAT Watch CB5880-54L'\n  - Name='Seiko 5 Sports Field Series Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's BX1003-08E Eco Drive World Time Perpetual Calendar'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Promaster Watch'\n  - Name='Men's Orient Revival World Map RA-AA0E01S19B'\n  - Name='Casio Pro-Trek Men's Solar Ana-Digital Watch'\n  - Name='Casio - PRG-601PE-5ER - Armbanduhr - Funkuhr - Solar - Herren - Pro Trek'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Titanium Watch with Mineral Crystal'\n  - Name='Timex Mk1 x Fortnite Quartz Black Dial Watch TW2W97000 Men's'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Collegiate Easy Reader Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SRPG39 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SRPG41 5 Sports Watch'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports SSK017 Automatic GMT Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic GMT'\n  - Name='Casio Analog Digital Combination Dial Quartz Watch AMW870A-2AV Men's'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

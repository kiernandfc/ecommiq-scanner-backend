Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, it’s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Tissot Women's Lovely Square Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Prx Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Men's RA-AA0814R19B'\n  - Name='Orient Field Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Orient Kanno Automatic Blue Dial Men's Watch RA-AA0916L19B'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Blue GMT Silicone Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Dillinger Chronograph Leather Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Quartz Pocket Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Quartz Analog Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Pr100'\n  - Name='Hamilton Khaki Field Pioneer Auto Wrist Watch'\n  - Name='Orient 75th Anniversary Bambino Solar Quartz'\n  - Name='Orient Men's Watch Mako Solar RA-TX0201L10B'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Classic Quartz Nylon Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Three-Hand Date Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Alba Military Field Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Regatta Automatic Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Le Freak Nile Rodgers Special Edition Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova 1940's U.s.m.c. 10ak Small Seconds Military Wristwatch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Chronograph Quartz Watch with Brown Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Regatta Automatic Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Classic Aerojet GMT Quartz Stainless Steel'\n  - Name='Casio Watch LF30W-3A'\n  - Name='CASIO Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Mens Chronograph Quartz Watch with Leather Strap JR1487 AJR1487'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

Each object in the array must have 'competitor_product_name' (the exact competitor product name provided in the input), 'relevancy_score' (an integer 1-10), and 'rationale' (a brief explanation for the score).\n\nThe relevancy scale is 1-10:\n- 1: Not relevant at all.\n- 10: Identical product.\n\nImportant scoring guidelines:\n- Focus on product function, features, silhouette, and construction\n- DO NOT emphasize color or pattern when scoring, as the reference product may encompass a wide range of colors/patterns not specified\n- Consider the core product type, shape, materials, and intended use\n- Evaluate if the products serve similar purposes and would appeal to similar customers\n- Ensure every competitor product listed receives a score.\n",

It’s equipped with luminous hands and our INDIGLO® backlight, and on the blue dial, you’ll find a date window complete with a magnifier for enhanced viewing, both 12- and 24-hour time indexes, and the iconic “we.” logo of the Timex Weekender as a reminder that any boring old day can become unforgettable if it’s spent with our favorite people.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Fossil Machine Chronograph Men's Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen C7 Automatic Dial Men's Watch NH8391-51'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Corso Strap Watch'\n  - Name='Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Calendrier Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's High Precision Chronograph Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Minimalist Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Dress Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Nate Leather Chronograph Watch JR1390'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Sports Automatic SNZG09K1 Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Presage Automatic SRPB77'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Solar Chronograph SSC141'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's Essentials Chronograph Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.

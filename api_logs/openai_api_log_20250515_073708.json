Its key feature is its shock-resistant 38mm case rendered in true titanium, offering incredible durability while ensuring a comfortably lightweight feel on the wrist. Reinforcing its 200m water resistance are a screw-down crown and screw-on caseback that effectively keep water out, while the light gray dial features a date window at 3 o'clock and luminescent hands and hour markers for enhanced visibility in lowlight conditions. Clean and modern, itâ€™s powered by a reliable quartz movement and features a sapphire crystal for optimal clarity, a sturdy crown protector, and a smooth grain Italian leather strap ethically sourced from and gold-rated by the Leather Working Group (LWG) and complete with contrast side stitches.\n\nCompetitor Products to Evaluate (Max 25):\n  - Name='Timex Men's Expedition CAT5 41mm Watch TW4B30400'\n  - Name='Timex Men's Waterbury Classic Stainless Steel Watch with Leather Strap'\n  - Name='Tissot PRX Powermatic 80 Steel & 18K Gold Diamond Bezel'\n  - Name='Hamilton Men's Khaki Field Swiss Quartz Military Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Fenmore Multifunction Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Classic Dream'\n  - Name='Tissot Classic Dream Lady Watch'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's 5 Automatic Watch SNK809K2'\n  - Name='Seiko Prospex Men's Fieldmaster Mechanical Automatic Watch'\n  - Name='Casio Men's Watch MTP-1370L-1AVDF'\n  - Name='Orient 75th Anniversary Bambino Version 9'\n  - Name='Skagen Mother Of Pearl Watch Pair'\n  - Name='Skagen Ladies Klassik Rose Gold Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Men's Gold-Tone Stainless Steel Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Female Analog Stainless Steel Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Freja Steel-Mesh Watch'\n  - Name='Fossil Men's Everett Chronograph Quartz Watch'\n  - Name='Bulova Men's Watch Classic 96B261'\n  - Name='TISSOT Women's Lovely Round 19.5mm Watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's PR 100 Chronograph watch'\n  - Name='Tissot Men's Le Locle Powermatic 80 Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Accessories Watch'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Signatur Lille Quartz Watch and Bracelet Set'\n  - Name='Skagen Women's Classic Black Dial Watch 914SBXC'\n  - Name='Seiko Men's SNXF05 Seiko 5 Automatic Steel Watch'\n\nBased on the reference product description and each competitor product's name, please provide the relevancy score for *each* competitor product using the 1-10 scale.
